# Abstract

The paper introduces and evaluates the project [*Open Arabic Periodical Editions*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) as a case study of minimal computing. It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitisation and computational methods for the exploration of digitised cultural heritage from the as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, english-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitisation efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words without any funding and through re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.

# Introduction

Early Arabic periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries were at the core of social developments and formative discourses of modern(ising) societies that carry continued prominence across the region and beyond: the Arabic (cultural) renaissance ([nahḍa]{custom-style="Transcription"}), Arab nationalism or the Islamic reform movement ([ṣalafiyya]{custom-style="Transcription"}), to name just a few. Yet, the vast majority of journals and newspapers remain obscure and understudied beyond a few well-known titles from Beirut and Cairo. As physical artefacts---frequently printed with cheap ink on cheap paper and handled without care in transit---they are vulnerable to neglect and active destruction. Neoliberal defunding of cultural heritage institutions as a global phenomenon is compounded by an onslaught of iconoclasts, failing institutions, and wars ravaging Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.

Turning to Gil and Ortega's question of "What do we need?" [@Gil+2016, 29], the answer, therefore is simple: preservation and access!  Societies of the Global South  have a right to unhampered access to their own cultural record---a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North. Access would also allow the scholarly communities concerned with the histories of Middle Eastern societies to study them through their own cultural production.

The following paper consists of two parts. I begin with challenging the equation of "digitisation = access" by outlining the layers of inaccessibility inherent to existing digitisation efforts of cultural artefacts from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean---historically multilingual and multiscriptural societies, whose material heritage has been and continues to be looted, destroyed and neglected; cultural artefacts, which resist digitisation by being dependent on scripts other than Latin (such as Arabic, Armenian, Syriac and Hebrew scripts) and calendars---and corresponding conceptions of time---other than the Gregorian (such as the Ottoman fiscal, or [mālī]{custom-style="Transcription"}, calendar, the reformed Julian calendar or the Islamic [hijrī]{custom-style="Transcription"}); and contemporary societies, who cannot draw on the on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North.
The second part introduces the project [Open Arabic Periodical Editions ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][openarabicpe_blog] as an attempt to address some of these layers of inaccessibility through creatively bootstrapping existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework to produce and distribute open scholarly periodical editions under the affordances of the Global South. I argue that [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} proves the feasibility of our bootstrapping approach by, inter alia, having published five full-text editions of Arabic journals originally published in Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus between 1892 and 1918 with a total of 20 volumes comprising 246 issues, 12,830 pages that link to digital facsimiles, and 3,166,783 words, without any resources beyond voluntary labour and private laptops.



# Inaccessibility of digitised Arabic periodicals

The first layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is a knowledge gap rooted in the physical artefact and its history. Scholars have written on the late Ottoman periodical press of the Eastern Mediterranean since the early twentieth century [E.g. @DiTarrazi+1913+TarikhAlsihafaAlarabiyya; @Yalman+1914] and  there is a plethora of encyclopaedic works on the Arabic press [E.g.   @Muruwwa+1961; @AlRifāʿī+1969b; @Dāghir+1978; @Ilyās+1982a; @Khūrīya+1976; @ʿAbduh+1948; @Tikrītī+1969; @Ḥasanī+1957], listing titles and dates of first publication. Yet, the history of the vast majority of individual titles remains unknown and only a handful of periodicals have been the subject of systematic studies [E.g. @Glaß+2004b; @Cioeta+1979a; @Dierauff+2018; @Beška+2017]. This is particularly true for all places beyond the traditional scholarly focus of Beirut and Cairo. If we were interested in the series of food riots that shook cities across the pre-dominantly Arabic speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire in summer 1910, we consequently would not know which contemporary newspapers and journals from Homs, Hama or Gaza could be consulted for reports on these events. 

The second layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is a direct consequence of the knowledge gap and can be summarised as a digitisation bias rooted in collection bias and survival bias. Publishers sought to minimise the cost of publishing periodicals and durability of printed copies was not necessary their primary concern. Libraries in the modern sense were established across the region from the late 19th century onwards and many indeed collected newspapers as did individuals and institutions outside the region. 
Many of these periodical collections came about by chance and, to a large extent, reflect local, regional and global distribution networks and individual publishers' ability to donate library copies long after their publication. Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, for instance, gifted library copies of [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} 2 from 1907/08 to his friend Jūrj Fākhūri in 1914 and to the library of al-Ṣalāḥiyya college in Jerusalem in 1916. The former is now held by the University of Minnesota and a facsimile is made available through [Hathitrust][hathitrust]. The later ended up in the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library in Jerusalem and was digitised by the British Library's [Endangered Archives Programme][eap].[^fn1] 
Preservation of these brittle materials is costly and frequent, prolonged wars, regime changes, and economic crises continue to have a devastating effect on surviving holdings.   The Lebanese National Library, for instance, was shut down and its collections, including the extensive periodical collections, were hastily stuffed into boxes and stored in the port of Beirut in 1975, where they remained for the next 40 years. A rehabilitation project has been under way since 2003 and reading rooms were opened to the public in 2018 but the status of the periodical collections remains opaque.

Surviving copies of early Arabic periodicals are consequently scattered across libraries and private collections worldwide. Locating a specific title and issue or all titles published at a particular place is a tedious endeavour exacerbated by the lack of online catalogues. Existing catalogues are not necessarily published or digitised beyond the onsite records. The website of the Lebanese National Library, for instance, still advertises its catalogue as forthcoming. Union catalogues, on the other hand, haven fallen out of fashion and should probably be read as historical sources rather than finding aids [E.g. @ElHadi+1965; @Hopwood+1970; @Aman+1979; @DeJong+1979; @Iḥdādan+1984; @Khūrī+1985; @Höpp+1994; @Atabaki+1995]. Known and confirmable collections are predominantly located in the Global North and frequently incomplete.  [@fig:holdings-muqtabas] illustrates the combined survival, collection, and cataloguing biases with the example of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī's monthly journal [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} published in Cairo and later Damascus between 1906 and 1918. Based on data from [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and the [Arabic Union Catalogue ([ArUC]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})](https://www.aruc.org/), we can locate only eight complete collections worldwide: five in the US, two in Lebanon, and one each in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, including a reprint published by Dār Ṣādir in Beirut in 1992.

Digitisation and hosting digital artefacts are expensive and the cost scales almost linearly. In need to justify their expenses, curators will almost always turn to the rare and beautiful. Hundreds of thousands of periodical pages in foreign languages are frequently not considered important enough to warrant this investment for institutions in the Global North. Funds, infrastructures and access to the physical artefacts, on the other hand, are commonly not available in the Global South. In consequence, we witness a neo-colonial absence of the Global South from the digital cultural record [@Risam+2019; c.f. @Gooding+2018, 149-157; @Thylstrup+2018, 79-100]. In the absence of aggregators or an index, specific titles are incredibly hard to find in the patchwork of existing, eclectic, collections of digitised periodicals.[^fn2]

The third layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is one of socio-technical infrastructures:
 Digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the epistemic hegemony of late twentieth-century, anglo-american neoliberal capitalism.
Most [*digitised*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of application programming interfaces ([API]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s) or the option to download data in standardised, open file formats.[^fn3] Reading [*access*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} to these silos is frequently restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing.
Proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic [C.f. @Mansour+2020; @Wrisley+2019; @Wrisley+2016], while bibliographic metadata is regularly limited to the issue level and woefully inadequate. This is due to ambiguity of data in the physical artefact, limited knowledge about these artefacts among librarians and the contractors, who did the actual digitising work, and software stacks incapable of handling anything but hegemonic Western concepts of dates and names and Western scripts. In consequence, bibliographic metadata are recorded and shared in transcription to Latin script---of which there are as many varieties as there are languages written in Latin script (see [#fig:interface])[@Grallert+2020]. Although things are improving in recent years and many catalogues can now display Arabic script, re-cataloguing of the original script is costly and not a priority for vendors.[^cf1]

Downloading content in order to circumvent  ill-suited interfaces is limited to individually identifiable users. Bulk download frequently violates terms of use and most vendors try to prevent this on the technical level---at least in one case, bulk download will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range.

![Annotated interface of the [Translatio platform](https://digitale-sammlungen.ulb.uni-bonn.de/ulbbnioa/periodical/titleinfo/3384757?lang=en) (University of Bonn) for a digitised copy of the Arabic journal *al-ʿIrfān*. Next to a facsimile of the front cover, they provide an English  interface ([*yellow*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) for the bibliographic information, some of which is presented in German ([*green*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) and some in Arabic in Latin transcription ([*purple*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) according to the system of the "Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft" ([DMG]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})](/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/translatio_interface-languages_annotated.png){#fig:interface}

<!-- table: ../../s0fb41f86/table_accessibility-of-digitised-collections.md -->

The fourth layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is the digital artefact itself:
[*Digitised*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} commonly means scanned facsimiles with limited or no text layer due, inter alia, to the abysmal state of Arabic OCR.[^cf2] Available text layers are frequently hidden, while vendors foreground full-text "search" that won't ever report false negatives and verifiable information on error rates is either inexistent or not published.
On the other hand,  informal online-libraries of Arabic literature, most prominent and popular among them  [*al-Maktaba al-shāmila*][shamela] (The Comprehensive Library),[^cf3]  provide access to a small number of full-text editions of Arabic periodicals based on the work of anonymous human transcribers. Unfortunately, they do not provide information on editorial principles, the quality of the transcription or the material artefact they were based on.[^cf4] In addition, such informal "editions" lack information linking the digital remediation to the original artefact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research. In a final twist, I found that the informal editions from *al-Maktaba al-shāmila*, with all their gaps and omissions, were rendered as images with a pseudo-original layout to provide "fakesimiles" and served through [*Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya*][alsharekh] (Archive of literary and cultural Arabic journals), the largest Arabic online platform for historical periodicals.[^cf5] 
<!-- modelling? Na! -->

These four layers of inaccessibility have an already crippling effect on any Arabic speaker from Syria, Jordan or Palestine with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North. They are, however, further compounded by the infrastructural dependencies of digital remediations on access to devices, internet connections, and electricity. Neither of these can be taken for granted for the societies of the Global South. In the---all too frequent---worst case, devices are old, internet connections are slow, traffic is prohibitively expensive, and electricity is perilously scarce [C.f. @Aiyegbusi+2019]. Because OpenArabicPE was set-up in and run from Beirut, Lebanon, I illustrate this multi-layered "digital divide"[^fn4] with the Lebanese example: only 15% of inhabitants have access to a landline and less than 1% have a broadband subscription, while 73% have a mobile phone [@CentralIntelligenceAgency+2020]. Many people rely on mobile internet connections because wired infrastructures are insufficiently deployed or because they cannot sign-up for a landline due to an unofficial rent agreement. They might also have no access to a personal computer or the necessary private space to use one due to crammed living conditions. Mobile internet connections, while by and large reliable and fast ([4G]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}), are prohibitively expensive. 20GB traffic or 30 days of service, whatever is less, cost about 40 USD while at least 30 per cent of the population lived on less than 120 USD a month in 2018 [@chadi2018UNDPLatestPoverty; @fadel2018ThirdLebaneseLive]. Consequently, plans to levy a daily one-dollar tax on the usage of widely popular WhatsApp ignited wide-spread popular protest against the government and the entire political class in October 2019. Electricity has been another major issue. For the last decades, ever rising demand could not be matched by constantly decreasing supply. The single, state-run utility relies on insufficient power plants and imported, subsidised fuel. Consequently, even before the collapse of the economy since 2019, the capital city of Beirut suffered from regular daily power cuts of three hours. Although heavily subsidised, electricity is expensive and easily came in at about 120 USD per month per household.  Generator subscriptions to offset power cuts were equally  expensive.[^fn5]
The impact of these infrastructural realities is not limited to individual users of digital cultural artefacts but also severely impacts institutions planning to host them. At work, for instance, I share a single connection, recently upgraded to 24Mbps, with 20 colleagues and another 20 library users.  




# Bootstrapping for access

["Open Arabic Periodical Editions" ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][openarabicpe_blog] was born out of frustration in August 2015 in order to address the socio-technical layers of inaccessibility of existing digitised Arabic periodicals with the affordances of the Global South. Building on the guiding principles of *simplicity* and *credibility* for the sake of *accessibility* and *sustainability*, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} was inspired by Alex Gil's talk on *minimal computing* at [Digital Humanities Institute---Beirut][dhib] and discussions at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute][dhsi] 2015. The idea is simple: re-use---sometimes creatively---openly available data, tools, and infrastructures to produce open, collaborative, scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s resources are extremely constrained: we have no funds, no staff and no equipment beyond volunteering interns. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, therefore, also represents (and reflects the changing boundaries of) my own ability "to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, without the help we can't get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of, with, and beyond institutional libraries and schools" [@Gil+2016, 29]. As such, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} resembles an attempt at what Valeria Graziano, Marcell Mars and Tomislav Meda have recently called "pirate care" [@Graziano+2019. See also @Mars+2019].

## The data layer

On the data level, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} combines the virtues of immensely popular, but non-academic  informal online libraries of volunteers on the one hand with academic/institutional scanning efforts as well as editorial expertise on the other.  We transformed the digital text (EPub, HTML) of six Arabic periodicals (see [@]) from [*al-Maktaba al-shāmila*][shamela] into an open, standardised file format (XML) following the [Text Encoding Initiative ([TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][tei]'s guidelines[@teiconsortium2020TEIP5Guidelines; c.f. @DfgPraxisregelnDigitalisierung+2016] and link each page to digital facsimiles from various sources, namely [EAP][eap], [HathiTrust][hathitrust], and [*Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya*][alsharekh]. We also model the periodicals with light structural mark-up for articles, sections, mastheads and bylines and other bibliographic information.[^fn6] Bibliographic metadata on every article and in common standardised formats such as BibTeX and MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) is then automatically generated from the modelled source.[^fn7] Thus, we provide the advantages of truly digital editions and a means to verify the text layer and our mark-up against facsimiles of the original artefact. Linking page breaks to facsimiles, although trivial, is extremely labour-intensive because they seemingly did not matter enough to the anonymous transcribers of *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* to be consistently recorded. Each of the c.8000 page breaks in [*al-Muqtabas*][muqtabas_git] and [*al-Ḥaqāʾiq*][haqaiq_git], therefore, needed to be manually marked up by volunteers.[^fn8] My gratitude goes to Dimitar Dragnev, Talha Güzel, Dilan Hatun, Hans Magne Jaatun, Xaver Kretzschmar, Daniel Lloyd, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick, Manzi Tanna-Händel and Layla Youssef, who have contributed their time to this task.

## The presentation layer

[TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is certainly not *simple* and comes with a steep learning curve. Bidirectional [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} with left-to-right tags and right-to-left text is not particularly *accessible* either, even if specialised [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}-editing software would better support it. However, [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is both *sustainable* and *credible* as an underlying format and the direction of a script is only relevant if rendered on a two-dimensional surface for human readers and editors.

Presenting facsimiles and text side-by-side for the validation of the latter with the help of the former is core to [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s claim of credibility. Therefore, and in order to make the editions accessible to readers with as little overhead as possible, we heavily modified the [[TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate](http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/) [@walsh2016TEIBoilerplate; @walsh2013TEIBoilerplate] for the use with Arabic texts. Our adaptation  also provides access to a table of contents, limited browsing to neighbouring issues, and bibliographic metadata on the article level [@OpenArabicPE:boilerplate]. By rendering [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files locally in a web browser on the reader's computer with [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and [CSS]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, we remove the need for backend servers and internet connections. We added a simple system to provide multiple localisations and most parts of the interface have been translated to Arabic.  Editions can be downloaded, distributed through [USB]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} keys, and run locally. This also removes the need to produce reading surrogates whenever the main [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} was changed.

Linking to digital facsimiles already available on the internet is commonly legal and since hosting and serving large files is expensive, it is the preferred option from our project's point of view. If we were to produce our own facsimiles through scanning, I would recommend uploading them to the [Internet Archive][internetarchive], which currently develops IIIF support.[^fn10] From the readers' perspective, linked online facsimiles require stable, fast and affordable internet connections. Downloading them once and serving them  locally would be the preferred option but will most likely violate user agreements, licences and copyright depending on vendors and jurisdictions (It is, nevertheless, trivial since the links are an inherent part of the [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files' `<facsimile>` node).

<!-- Zotero: solves the problem of browsing/search across issues with no backend -->
Distributing digital corpora of hundreds of periodical issues without a backend severely restricts the ability to search and browse across issues. The (academic) reference manager [Zotero][zotero] is a staple of the open-source community, which, among many other things, allows sharing an unlimited amount of bibliographic references for free. I, therefore, opted to host all bibliographic metadata in a constantly updated public [Zotero Group][openarabicpe_zotero] instead of building a static website with pre-computed indexes, tables of contents etc. Each reference in Zotero links to the relevant section in the periodical editions through a stable URL. Readers can, therefore, use either Zotero's web interface or standalone client as a port of entry to all of [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s editions. 
Full-text search across all issues and editions is provided by means of automatically updated sitemaps and Google's [Programmable Search Engines](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) and Search Console. 

## Facilitating re-use through licenses

Within the academic framework we are operating in, we depend on explicit licences to facilitate the use and re-use of our data and tools.[^fn11] We assume that the content of periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean before 1920 is in the public domain even under the most restrictive definitions (i.e. US copyright law).  The enormous amount of human labour required for digitising cultural artefacts, on the other hand, is commonly actively hidden. Within academic historiography, for instance, using digital remediations is still frowned upon as cheating (everybody does it but only few talk about it). This evidenced by [a search in JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicResults?acc=off&Query=shamela.ws&wc=on&fc=off&group=none&refreqid=search%3Ab890d4a34c3e21a4999f950b7d357685) for references to the URLs of works from *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* in academic texts, which returned a grand total of 16 hits [c.f. @Miller+2018, 104]. Retaining copyright of our own editorial contributions in the form of [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][cc-by-sa-4] is at least a reminder that all contributors need to be transparently credited for their work. We share our tools under a [MIT licence][mit-license] whenever possible. 

## The infrastructure

Editions and tools are maintained using a combination of [.git]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and [GitHub](github) for distributed version control. Each edit is transparently credited to a contributor with an email address and a timestamp. Github also provides free hosting of the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate-based webview for our editions through [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. Github, of course, is a commercial platform and  owned by Microsoft. They might go out of business at any point in the future but they are a core staple of the open-source movement. The platform itself is built on open-source software, protecting us against a lock-in of our data, and its services are free-of-cost to the user.

While platforms for shared version control, such as GitHub, are great for collaborative editing and hosting data, they cannot replace an archive or long-term repository. We use [Zenodo][zenodo] for this purpose. Zenodo is an open and free-to-use, EU-funded research data repository originally developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}). Zenodo registers (versioned) [Digital Object Identifiers ([DOI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][doi] and integrates with various Open Science infrastructures such as scholarly aggregators of metadata or [Open Researcher and Contributor [ID]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} ([ORCID]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][orcid] for unambiguously identifying contributors. Zenodo also integrates with GitHub by automatically archiving each release of data and tools and recording all contributors as found in the `.git` repository.

## Problems of bootstrapping

The main problem of bootstrapping is the reliance on external data, tools, and services, which are beyond our control. Every one of these dependencies will eventually break. The only question is when. The main mitigation strategies are open and widely supported standards and a minimal software stack. On the data level, the links to the facsimiles are the most volatile component and we already encountered three major instances of link rot. Two were caused by vendors moving servers and changing protocols: The British Library moved the Endangered Archives Programme to IIIF in 2017 and *Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya* moved to a new domain in 2019. In another instance, Hathitrust removed the facsimiles of Princeton's copy of *al-Haqāʾiq* (vol.1, 1910) from the public domain in 2016.[^fn12]

On the representation layer, [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate was the only viable option to render [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files in the browser without a backend in 2015 and it still works. However, web browsers and the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}  have moved on. All major browsers still support [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} transformation but with two limitations: First, the web has moved on to Javascript and [JSON]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}. [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} support is stuck with version 1, which was superseded by [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} 2 in 2007 and [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} 3 in 2017. If (!) browsers continue to support [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, it won't be further developed. Second, browser vendors tighten the screws on security. Running [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} transformations on local files is considered attempted cross-site scripting and, consequently, aborted by Google's Chrome. Firefox will transform local [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files but only with remotely hosted [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}. At the time of writing, only Apple's Safari allows for rendering our editions without any internet connection. Third, [CETEIcean][ceteicean] has matured into a Javascript-based alternative to [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate with the support of the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} consortium [@cayless2020CETEIcean; @cayless2018CETEIceanTEIBrowser]. All future developments of [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s webview will therefore move to CETEIcean.

Hosting is another challenge. I originally decided to directly render [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files as available in the GitHub repositories. This made sure that readers always saw the most current version of the data without any additional steps. [Rawgit][rawgit-old] allowed to directly serve files from any branch of a GitHub repository with the correct content type. But the service was shut down in 2019 because people ran malware exploits directly from their GitHub repositories.[^fn13] [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} has therefore moved to GitHub's own [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] service, which serves files from the `gh-pages` branch.

# Conclusion

This paper contrasted the promises of digitisation with the stark reality of digitised cultural artefacts from the Global South against the backdrop of Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean as an experience of multiple, compounding layers of *inaccessibility*---depending at the same time on the material artefact itself, remediated through neo-colonial power structures, and on one's own position within a globalised hegemony of anglophone neoliberal capitalism.

I then introduced our project Open Arabic Periodical Editions as a proposal for and concrete implementation of bootstrapping existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework to produce and distribute open scholarly periodical editions under the affordances of the Global South. The tools and infrastructures outlined above are not specifically tailored to Arabic texts or periodicals and can be applied to material in other languages and scripts and from other regions (the language of the presentation layer depends on the language of the editions and defaults back to English). Current developments in open, machine-learning based, and language-agnostic approaches to OCR are aided by [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} through re-purposing our editions as ground truth for training models and will eventually remove the dependency on pre-existing digital texts.

[^fn1]: Handwritten note on [*al-Muqtabas* 2(1), p.1](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_13.TEIP5.xml#pb_1.d2e814).

[^fn2]: I am part of the endeavour to gather and openly share information on all holdings of  Arabic periodicals; [@Mestyan.Grallert+2012+ProjectJaraid].

[^fn3]: I compiled information on the accessibility of platforms serving digitised Arabic periodicals, which is available at <https://tillgrallert.github.io/s0fb41f86/table_accessibility-of-digitised-collections.html>.

[^cf1]: For an example, see EAP's digitisation of the Ottoman newspaper *Yenī Taṣvīr-i Efkār* from Istanbul, which was catalogued with the faulty Arabic title *Taṣwīr Afkār* and as published in Jerusalem; <https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-18-1#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0≤>.

[^cf2]: [@Märgner+2012a] is still relevant for current platforms; see the Internet Archive's claim that Arabic is "currently not OCRable"; e.g. <https://archive.org/details/1_20191109_20191109_1843>. Recent years have seen huge advances with the application of machine-learning algorithms; c.f. [@Kiessling+2017]. They will eventually find their way into HathiTrust etc.; see [@2020+HathiTrustResearchCenter]. But without GUI's (in Arabic!) and due to their reliance on server-side computing, which needs to be paid, these also remain largely inaccessible to the general publicimprove.

[^cf3]: *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* was first published on CD-ROM and went online in 2005; [@Verkinderen+2020+AlMaktabaAlShamilaShort]. For evaluations of *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* as the basis for scholarly corpus building efforts see [@Belinkov+2016; @Alrabiah+2013].

[^cf4]: We found that *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* consequently removed footnotes and terms in scripts other than Arabic. Transcribers normalised the text and occasionally left Arabic notes in the text, from which we can deduce that they were Arabic speakers.

[^cf5]: There is a huge and unmarked gap in *al-Maktaba al-shāmila*'s transcription of *al-Muqtabas* 5(7) between [p.463](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_54.TEIP5.xml#pb_61.d1e2036) and [p.466](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_54.TEIP5.xml#pb_64.d1e2045), which is reproduced in [this "fakesimile"](https://archive.alsharekh.org/MagazinePages/Magazine_JPG/AL_moqtabs/Al_moqtabs_1910/Issue_7/605.JPG).

[^fn4]: For a recent conceptualisation of the term see [@Ragnedda+2019]. Unfortunately, while acknowledging the multiple socio-technological layers, they focus solely on the internet and do not mention the hegemony of English.This is also true for [@Townsend+2013, 168-193]. add literature on the digital divide. This might also alread be part of [^11]

[^fn5]: It must be noted that corruption and waste are not the only culprits to blame. Israel deliberately damaged and destroyed power plants in the 2006 war.

[^fn6]: Our TEI customisation for Arabic periodicals is openly available at <https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/OpenArabicPE_ODD>.

[^fn7]: Our code is openly available at <https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/convert_tei-to-bibliographic-data>. It uses `<tei:biblStruct>` as an intermediary format and can also generate YAML and Zotero RDF.

[^fn8]: In other instances, such as the journals [*Lughat al-ʿArab*][lughat_git] and [*al-Ustādh*][ustadh_git], *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* did provide page breaks that correspond to a printed edition.

[^fn9]: The cut-off date is currently 1918.

[^fn10]: According to example code in the documentation, IIIF support is in development since at least 2015; [@IIIFDocumentation].

[^fn11]: For an introduction to the conceptual critique of copyrights see [@Hall+2016, 1-9]. For a specific application to TEI XML files see [@Hannesschläger+2020].

[^fn12]: My inquiries about the legal basis for this decision have not been replied to
