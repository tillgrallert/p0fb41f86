# Abstract

The paper introduces and evaluates the project [*Open Arabic Periodical Editions*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) as a case study of minimal computing. It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitisation and computational methods for the exploration of digitised cultural heritage from the as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, english-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitisation efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words without any funding and through re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.

# Introduction

Early Arabic periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries were at the core of social developments and formative discourses of modern(ising) societies that carry continued prominence across the region and beyond: the Arabic (cultural) renaissance ([nahḍa]{custom-style="Transcription"}), Arab nationalism or the Islamic reform movement ([ṣalafiyya]{custom-style="Transcription"}), to name just a few. Yet, the vast majority of journals and newspapers remain obscure and understudied beyond a few well-known titles from Beirut and Cairo. As physical artefacts---frequently printed with cheap ink on cheap paper and handled without care in transit---they are vulnerable to neglect and active destruction. Neoliberal defunding of cultural heritage institutions as a global phenomenon is compounded by an onslaught of iconoclasts, failing institutions, and wars ravaging Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.

Turning to Gil and Ortega's question of "What do we need?" [@Gil+2016, 29], the answer, therefore is simple: preservation and access!  Societies of the Global South  have a right to unhampered access to their own cultural record---a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North. Access would also allow the scholarly communities concerned with the histories of Middle Eastern societies to study them through their own cultural production.

The following paper consists of two parts. I begin with challenging the equation of "digitisation = access" by outlining the layers of inaccessibility inherent to existing digitisation efforts of textual cultural artefacts from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. The Eastern Mediterranean, between Mesopotamia in the East and the Libyan desert in the West, the mountains of Anatolia in the north and the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula in the south, is home to historically multilingual and multiscriptural societies. Predominantly Arabic speaking, the area had been part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries until the end of World War I. The material cultural heritage of these societies has been and continues to be looted, destroyed and neglected as exemplified by the recent scandal surrounding the Museum of the Bible in Washington or the destruction of Palmyra by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Their textual cultural heritage resist digitisation by being dependent on scripts other than Latin (such as Arabic, Armenian, Syriac or Hebrew scripts) and calendars, as well as corresponding conceptions of time, other than the Gregorian (such as the Ottoman fiscal, or [mālī]{custom-style="Transcription"}, calendar, the reformed Julian calendar or the Islamic [hijrī]{custom-style="Transcription"} calendar). This is further exacerbated by their contemporary heirs relative lack of resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures if compared to the Global North.
The second part introduces the project [Open Arabic Periodical Editions ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][openarabicpe_blog] as a practical critique of these layers of inaccessibility  through creatively bootstrapping existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework to produce and distribute open scholarly periodical editions with the affordances of the Global South. I argue that [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} proves the feasibility of bootstrapping approaches by having published six full-text editions of Arabic journals originally published in Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus between 1892 and 1918 with a total of 41 volumes comprising 645 issues, 12,830 pages that link to digital facsimiles,[^fn1] and 9,311,376 words ([@tbl:corpus]), without any resources beyond voluntary labour and private laptops.



# Inaccessibility of digitised Arabic periodicals

The first layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is a knowledge gap rooted in the physical artefact and its history. Scholars have written on the late Ottoman periodical press of the Eastern Mediterranean since the early twentieth century [E.g. @DiTarrazi+1913+TarikhAlsihafaAlarabiyya; @Yalman+1914] and  there is a plethora of encyclopaedic works on the Arabic press [E.g.   @Muruwwa+1961; @AlRifāʿī+1969b; @Dāghir+1978; @Ilyās+1982a; @Khūrīya+1976; @ʿAbduh+1948; @Tikrītī+1969; @Ḥasanī+1957], listing titles and dates of first publication. Yet, the history of the vast majority of individual titles remains unknown and only a handful of periodicals have been the subject of systematic studies [E.g. @Glaß+2004b; @Cioeta+1979a; @Dierauff+2018; @Beška+2017]. This is particularly true for all places beyond the traditional scholarly focus of Beirut and Cairo.[^cf1] If we were interested in the series of food riots that shook cities across the predominantly Arabic speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire in summer 1910 [C.f. @Grallert+2019], we consequently would not know which contemporary newspapers and journals from Homs, Hama or Gaza could be consulted for reports on these events. 

The second layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is a direct consequence of the knowledge gap and can be summarised as a digitisation bias rooted in collection bias and survival bias [C.f. @Gooding+2018, 52-61]. Publishers sought to minimise the cost of publishing  and durability of printed newspaper and periodical copies was not necessarily their primary concern. Surviving copies are scattered across libraries and private collections around the globe. In the absence of a survey of collection histories, I deduce from the copies I have seen that many collections came about by chance and reflect local, regional and global distribution networks more than specific collection policies. We must also take into account individual publishers' agency in influencing collections through donations of library copies, even long after their publication. The Ottoman-Arab intellectual, journalist, founder of the Arab Scientific Academy, and Minister of Education, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī (1876--1953), for example, established the monthly journal [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} (The Digest) in Cairo in 1906. Kurd ʿAlī moved to his hometown of Damascus after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, where he continued to publish [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} until the end of World War I [@Seikaly+1981]. In 1914, six years after its publication in Cairo, Kurd ʿAlī gifted a library copy of the second year of [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} to his friend Jūrj Fākhūri. Two years later, he gifted another library copy of the same volume to the library of the Ṣalāḥiyya College in Jerusalem. The former is now held by the University of Minnesota and a digital facsimile can be accessed through [HathiTrust](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/image?id=umn.319510029968616;seq=12). The latter ended up in the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library in Jerusalem and was digitised by the British Library's [Endangered Archives Programme ([EAP]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][eap].[^fn2] 

Preservation of these brittle materials is costly and frequent, prolonged wars, regime changes, and economic crises continue to have a devastating effect on surviving holdings. The Lebanese National Library, for instance, was shut down and its collections, including extensive periodical collections, were hastily stuffed into boxes and stored in the port of Beirut in 1975, where they remained for the next forty-odd years. A rehabilitation project has been under way since 2003 and reading rooms were opened to the public in 2018 but the status of the periodical collections remains opaque.

Locating a specific title and issue or all titles published at a particular place is a tedious endeavour exacerbated by the state of online catalogues. Existing catalogues are not necessarily published or digitised beyond the onsite records. The website of the Lebanese National Library, for instance, still advertises its catalogue as forthcoming. Union catalogues, on the other hand, haven fallen out of fashion and should probably be read as historical sources rather than finding aids [E.g. @ElHadi+1965; @Hopwood+1970; @Aman+1979; @DeJong+1979; @Iḥdādan+1984; @Khūrī+1985; @Höpp+1994; @Atabaki+1995]. Known and confirmable collections are predominantly located in the Global North and frequently incomplete.  [@fig:holdings-muqtabas] illustrates the combined survival, collection, and cataloguing biases with the example of [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"}. Based on data from [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/) and the [Arabic Union Catalogue ([ArUC]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})](https://www.aruc.org/), we can locate only nine complete collections worldwide: five in the US, two in Lebanon, and one each in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, including a reprint published by Dār Ṣādir in Beirut in 1992.

Digitisation and hosting digital artefacts are expensive and the cost scales almost linearly. In need to justify their expenses, curators will almost always turn to the rare and beautiful. Hundreds of thousands of periodical pages in foreign languages are frequently not considered important enough to warrant this investment for institutions in the Global North. Funds, infrastructures and access to the physical artefacts, on the other hand, are commonly not available in the Global South. In consequence, we witness a neo-colonial absence of the Global South from the digital cultural record [@Risam+2019; c.f. @Gooding+2018, 149-157; @Thylstrup+2018, 79-100]. In the absence of aggregators or an index, specific titles are incredibly hard to find in the patchwork of existing collections of digitised periodicals. [@fig:jaraid-status] shows the distribution of all Arabic periodical titles published across the Middle East and North Africa between 1789 and 1929 based on [Project Jarāʾid](https://projectjaraid.githu.io/), a scholarly crowd-sourcing effort we are running since 2012 to gather publication and holdings data. Based on this data set, only 504 or 15,59% of the 3232 titles could be located in collections and only 148 or 4,58% have been at least partially digitised [@Mestyan.etal+2020+JaraidAchronology; @Mestyan.Grallert+2012+ProjectJaraid; @Mestyan.Grallert+2020+JaraIdChronology].

The third layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is one of socio-technical infrastructures:
 Digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the epistemic hegemony of late twentieth-century, anglo-american neoliberal capitalism.
Most [*digitised*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of application programming interfaces ([API]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s) or the option to download data in machine-actionable, standardised, open file formats. Reading [*access*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} to these silos is frequently restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing, a method to restrict access based on the geographic location of a user's IP address [see @tbl:platforms-access]. [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"}, for example, is commonly deemed in the public domain in the United States. Copies from the [University of Minnesota](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100658549) and [Princeton University](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008882293) have  are openly available online at HathiTrust---for scholars at member institutions and the general public in the US as determined by a user's IP address. Everyone else will see  blank pages. 
Downloading content in order to circumvent  ill-suited interfaces is often limited to individually identifiable users. Automated downloads frequently violate terms of use and most vendors try to prevent this on the technical level---at least in one case, detected attempts of automated downloads will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range with a blanket block.

Table: Accessibility of platforms serving [*digitised*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} Arabic periodicals. {#tbl:platforms-access}

[^tb2]: Claims to provide a "proprietary" PDF version, whose text layer is currently incompatible with Adobe's PDF reader. Download has, therefore, been disabled.

Proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic [C.f. @Mansour+2020; @Wrisley+2019; @Wrisley+2016], while bibliographic metadata is regularly limited to the issue level and woefully inadequate. This is due to ambiguity of data found in the physical artefact, such as ambiguous references to calendars in mastheads, limited knowledge about these artefacts among librarians and the contractors, who did the actual digitising work, and software stacks incapable of handling anything but Western scripts and hegemonic Western concepts of dates and names. In consequence, oftentimes incorrect bibliographic metadata are recorded and shared in transcription to Latin script---of which there are as many varieties as there are languages written in Latin script ([@fig:interface])[@Grallert+2020]. Take for example, the Ottoman Turkish newspaper [Yenī Taṣvīr-i Efkār]{custom-style="Transcription"} from Istanbul. Holdings at the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library were digitised through the Endangered Archives Programme. But Ottoman Turkish was written in Arabic script until 1924. The cataloguers   transcribed a truncated title into Latin script but they did so according to the rules for Arabic, which resulted in the grammatically wrong title [Taṣwīr Afkār]{custom-style="Transcription"}. In addition, they provided Jerusalem as place of publication instead of Istanbul (see <https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-18-1>).
 Although things are improving in recent years and many catalogues can now display Arabic script, re-cataloguing  the original script is costly and not a priority for vendors.

![Annotated interface of the [Translatio platform](https://digitale-sammlungen.ulb.uni-bonn.de/ulbbnioa/periodical/titleinfo/3384757?lang=en) (University of Bonn) for a digitised copy of the Arabic journal *al-ʿIrfān*. Next to a facsimile of the front cover, they provide an English  interface ([*yellow*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) for the bibliographic information, some of which is presented in German ([*green*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) and some in Arabic in Latin transcription ([*purple*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}) according to the system of the "Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft" ([DMG]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}).](/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/translatio_interface-languages_annotated.png){#fig:interface}


The second aspect of socio-technological inaccessibility is the hegemonial approach of computational systems to script through the metaphors of discrete characters and typesetting and by conceptually equating scripts with (national) languages [@Fiormonte.etal+2015+ThePoliticsof]. Yet, Arabic script is a writing system for many Asian and African languages [@Mumin.Versteegh+2014+TheArabicScript]. It runs from right-to-left with most letters connecting within a word. Letters have up to four forms depending on their position within a string while multiple letters share the same basic shape ([rasm]{custom-style="Transcription"}). Diacritical signs (dots) above and below the [rasm]{custom-style="Transcription"} have been introduced to unambiguously identify a letter ([@fig:arabic]). There are only few exceptions to these script-specific writing rules across languages.[^fn3] However, dots are not strictly necessary for reading and their use is subject to taste. Some regional cultural practices almost consistently omit them for specific letters, particularly at the end of words. 
Unicode as a character-encoding standard that enabled the vendor-independent exchange and interoperability of multilingual textual material of the networked age does not allow to adequately encode such cultural preference for ambiguity and forces transcribers to select a specific interpretation of the string in front of them. Transcribers have to either normalise orthographic variance or pick visually matching but "wrong" glyphs. On the other hand and due to being organised into (national) languages, Unicode provides multiple code points for the same glyph, introducing a potentially large variance in possible encodings for the same string of letters depending on the input keyboard of the transcribers. Egyptian Arabic speakers, for instance, would virtually never write the two dots underneath a final [yāʾ]{custom-style="Transcription"} (U+064A: ي). To mirror their cultural preference, they can either select the Arabic [alif maqṣūra]{custom-style="Transcription"} (U+0649: ى) or the Persian [ye]{custom-style="Transcription"} (U+06CC: ی).[^fn4] Unfortunately, search algorithms built into modern operating systems are not aware of this variance and any application software relying on them will return skewed results without additional efforts at regularisation or a reduction to the [rasm]{custom-style="Transcription"} [@Milo.Martinez+2019+ANewStrategy].

Words are underlined in [*red*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}. Ligatures of multiple letters are underlined in [*green*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}.](/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/arabic-script_annotated.png){#fig:arabic}

The fourth layer of [*inaccessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} is the digital artefact itself: [*Digitised*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} periodicals commonly mean scanned images (facsimiles) with limited or no text layer due to the particular challenges of Arabic script for optical character recognition ([OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) and the difficulty in automated layout recognition for dense multi-column page layouts. 
In addition to the characteristics of Arabic script outlined above and depending on typefonts and writing style, letters will form ligatures. They will not necessarily sit on a single base line and base lines can be tilted ([@fig:arabic]). Segmentation into letters as the traditional approach to [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} has consequently proven extremely complicated and error prone. Accuracy rates for leading Arabic [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} solutions are well below 75% on the word level [@Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic; @Alkhateeb.etal+2017+ArabicOpticalCharacter; cf. @Märgner+2012a; @Habash+2010+IntroductionToArabic], which causes the Internet Archive to state that the "language [is] not currently OCRable" [item description for @KurdAli+1923+GharaibAlGharba]. This is about to change with recent developments in machine-learning based approaches to [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and hand-written text recognition ([HTR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}), from [Kraken](http://kraken.re/), to [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) and [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), which generally have shown to reliably produce high levels of accuracy independent of input language and script, including Arabic [@Kiessling+2017]. The "Open Islamicate Texts Initiative Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project" ([OpenITI ACOP]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) will train recognition models for the most frequent fonts and types [@InitiativeOpenITI+2019+TheOpenIslamicate] and their technology will eventually find its way into HathiTrust [@2020+HathiTrustResearchCenter]. However, there is an important catch beyond the still unsolved layout recognition: machine-learning requires enormous resources---from labour time and the skills needed to use specialist software, to necessary hardware requirements  and power consumption [c.f. @Alkaoud.Syed+2020+OnTheImportance, p. 124; @Strubell.etal+2019+EnergyAndPolicy; @Baillot.etal+2021+DigitalHumanitiesAnd].

Commercial vendors and even some public institutions claim opaque break-throughs for in-house [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} technologies but none share their software, evaluation reports or even full text layers [E.g. @website_eapb]. Instead, their interfaces foreground full-text "search" capabilities with hits super-imposed onto the digital facsimiles. Exploratory searches often reveal a high number of false positives among the search results while the extent of false negatives, strings that should have been found but weren't, and, therefore, the veracity of full-text operations remains inherently unknown.

Finally, informal online-libraries of Arabic literature, most prominent and popular among them  [[al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}][shamela] (The Comprehensive Library, 2005--) [@Verkinderen+2020+AlMaktabaAlShamilaShort],  provide access to a small number of full-text editions of Arabic periodicals based on the work of anonymous human transcribers. Unfortunately, they do not provide information on editorial principles, the quality of the transcription or the material artefact they were based on.
In addition, such informal "editions" lack information linking the digital remediation to the original artefact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research. In a final twist, I found that the informal editions from [al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}, with all their gaps and omissions, were rendered as images with a pseudo-original layout to provide "fakesimiles" and served through [[Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya]{custom-style="Transcription"}][alsharekh] (Archive of literary and cultural Arabic journals), the largest Arabic online platform for historical periodicals.[^cf2]  While this reveals the status of seemingly faithful reproductions, the existence of such "fakesimiles" requires any scholar to exert additional scrutiny before using material from these informal platforms.

These four layers of inaccessibility have an already crippling effect on any Arabic speaker from Syria, Jordan or Palestine with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North. They are, however, further compounded by the infrastructural dependencies of digital remediations on access to devices, internet connections, and electricity. Neither of these can be taken for granted for the societies of the Global South. In the---all too frequent---worst case, devices are old, internet connections are slow, traffic is prohibitively expensive, and electricity is perilously scarce [C.f. @Aiyegbusi+2019]. Because OpenArabicPE was set-up in and run from Beirut, Lebanon, I illustrate this multi-layered "digital divide"[^fn5] with the Lebanese example: only 15% of inhabitants have access to a landline and less than 1% have a broadband subscription, while 73% have a mobile phone [@CentralIntelligenceAgency+2020]. Many people rely on mobile internet connections because wired infrastructures are insufficiently deployed or because they cannot sign-up for a landline due to an unofficial rent agreement. They might also have no access to a personal computer or the necessary private space to use one due to crammed living conditions. Mobile internet connections, while by and large reliable and fast ([4G]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}), are prohibitively expensive. 20GB traffic or 30 days of service, whatever is less, cost about 40 USD while at least 30 per cent of the population lived on less than 120 USD a month in 2018 [@Chadi+2018+UNDPLatestPoverty; @fadel2018ThirdLebaneseLive]. Consequently, plans to levy a daily one-dollar tax on the usage of widely popular WhatsApp ignited wide-spread popular protest against the government and the entire political class in October 2019. Electricity has been another major issue. For the last decades,  rising demand could not be matched by constantly decreasing supply. The single, state-run utility relies on insufficient power plants and imported, subsidised fuel. Consequently, the capital city of Beirut suffered from regular daily power cuts of three hours even before the collapse of the economy since 2019. Although heavily subsidised, electricity was expensive and easily came in at about 120 USD per month per household.  Generator subscriptions to offset power cuts were equally  expensive.[^fn6] The situation has deteriorated since. At the point of writing, the local currency lost 94% of its purchasing power for buying the necessary fuel for generating power on the international market and Beirut had about one hour of electricity per day.
The impact of these infrastructural realities is not limited to individual users of digital cultural artefacts but also severely impacts institutions planning to host them. At my home institution, a well-funded foreign research institute, for instance, we shared a single connection of 24Mbps. Simply loading the landing page for a single volume of [al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"} at the Endangered Archives Programme will require three seconds even under perfect conditions. With 20 colleagues and another 20 library users equally trying to access online services and resources, load time quickly multiplies tenfold and more. Browsing through a large number of scanned images behind such a bottleneck is a daunting task. Uploading multiple gigabytes of high-resolution scans to a cloud computing service for machine-learning based [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, for instance, is practically impossible and we rather ship hard drives and wait for months for the results.    


# Bootstrapping for access

I set up ["Open Arabic Periodical Editions" ([OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][openarabicpe_blog]  in August 2015 in order to address these socio-technical layers of inaccessibility of existing digitised Arabic periodicals with the affordances of the Global South and the tools at hand. Building on the guiding principles of [*simplicity*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} and [*credibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} for the sake of [*accessibility*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} and [*sustainability*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} was inspired by Alex Gil's talk at [Digital Humanities Institute---Beirut][dhib] during which he introduced the audience to the ideas of [[*minimal computing*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}][minimal] and by discussions and workshops at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute][dhsi] 2015. A second strand of inspiration were ideas of crowd-sourcing and democratic public domain editions based on distributed version control systems that had emerged from the open-source communities in the early 2010s [c.f. @Wittern+2013; @Shaffer+2013+GitHubForAcademics; @Forster+2012+PublicDomainEditions; @Reeve+2015+IntroducingGitLit; @Terras+2016+CrowdsourcingInThe]. 
The idea is simple: re-use---sometimes creatively---openly available data, tools, and infrastructures to produce and share open, collaborative, scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s resources were and remain extremely constrained: we have no funds, no staff beyond volunteering interns, and no equipment beyond our own computers. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, therefore, also represents (and reflects the changing boundaries of) our own ability "to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, without the help we can't get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of, with, and beyond institutional libraries and schools" [@Gil+2016, 29]. As such, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} represents a contribution to the digital commons [@Wittel+2013+CountercommodificationTheEconomy; @Hall+2016, 1-24] and provides a practical critique of neo-liberal capitalism along the lines of what Valeria Graziano, Marcell Mars and Tomislav Meda have recently called "pirate care" [@Graziano+2019; see also @Mars+2019].

## The data layer

On the data level, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} combines the virtues of immensely popular, but non-academic  informal online libraries of volunteers on the one hand with academic and institutional scanning efforts as well as editorial expertise on the other.  We transformed the digital text of six Arabic periodicals (see [@tbl:corpus]) published in Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus between 1892 and 1918 from [[al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}][shamela] from [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} (packaged as [EPUB]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) into an open, standardised plain-text file format ([XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) following the [Text Encoding Initiative ([TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][tei]'s guidelines[@teiconsortium2020TEIP5Guidelines; c.f. @DfgPraxisregelnDigitalisierung+2016] and linked each page to digital facsimiles from various sources, namely [[EAP]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}][eap], [Translatio][translatio], [HathiTrust][hathitrust], and [[Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya]{custom-style="Transcription"}][alsharekh]. Each periodical issue is modelled as a single file to keep with the original organisation principle of these compound texts. We then model each issue with light structural mark-up for articles, sections, mastheads and bylines, as well as other bibliographic information.[^fn7] As far as possible, authors and locations are identified and linked to local and international authority files. 
Bibliographic metadata on every article and in common standardised formats such as [BibTeX]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and [MODS]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} (Metadata Object Description Schema) is then automatically generated from the modelled [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} source.[^fn8] Thus, we provide the advantages of truly digital editions and a means to verify the text layer and our mark-up against facsimiles of the original artefact. 

[al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"} has been repeatedly evaluated for building scholarly corpora with a focus on distant reading approaches to classical texts [@Belinkov+2016; @Alrabiah+2013]. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} was the first to focus on modern genres and to expand this basis into reliable and citable digital scholarly editions. Going through two journals in our corpus for the purpose of locating page breaks also revealed some of [al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}'s editing practices, such as the omission of all footnotes and terms in scripts other than Arabic from the transcription. Most of the journals made extensive use of footnotes and articles covering recent developments in technology and sciences at the turn of the twentieth century often provided French, English, and Latin terms for clarification, which makes such systematic omissions relevant for evaluating distant reading approaches to the texts. Other scholars already noted that [al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}'s editors  omitted Rashīd Riḍā's commentary on the Qurʾān ([tafṣīr]{custom-style="Transcription"})  from their transcription of the monthly journal [al-Manār]{custom-style="Transcription"} (The Lighthouse) even though it accounted for more than one fifth of the journal's content [@Zemmin+2016, 232]. A combination of algorithmic searches for uncharacteristically short pages with close reading of these pages  further substantiated the hypothesis of human transcribers without quality control strategies such as double-keying. Most omissions can be plausibly explained by common human errors:  skipping a few words on a long line, jumping a small number of lines, or turning two pages at once. In other instances, transcribers even left completely unmarked comments in the transcription itself, stating, for example, that they couldn't read the following lines in the copy in front of them.[^cf3] From these notes and common normalisation of spelling variants, we can safely deduce that the transcribers were Arabic speakers. We are still looking for ways to adequately acknowledge their work beyond a generic reference in the metadata section of our [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files.

Linking page breaks to facsimiles, although trivial, proved extremely labour-intensive because page breaks seemingly did not matter enough to the anonymous transcribers  to be consistently recorded. Each of the c.8000 page breaks in the journals [[al-Muqtabas]{custom-style="Transcription"}][muqtabas_git] and [[al-Ḥaqāʾiq]{custom-style="Transcription"}][haqaiq_git] needed to be manually marked up by volunteers.[^fn9] My gratitude goes to Dimitar Dragnev, Talha Güzel, Dilan Hatun, Hans Magne Jaatun, Xaver Kretzschmar, Daniel Lloyd, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick, Manzi Tanna-Händel and Layla Youssef, who contributed their time to this task.

## The presentation layer

[TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is certainly not [*simple*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} and comes with a steep learning curve. Bidirectional [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} with left-to-right tags and right-to-left text is not particularly [*accessible*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} to readers and editors either, even if specialised [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}-editing software would better support it ([@fig:bidi-xml]). However, [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is both [*sustainable*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} and [*credible*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} as an underlying format and the direction of a script is only relevant if rendered on a two-dimensional surface for human readers and editors.

![Example of bidirectional XML from the beginning of [@oclc_1034545644-i_15-div_1.d2e634]](/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/xml_zuhur-v_2-i_4_annotated.png){#fig:bidi-xml}

Presenting facsimiles and text side-by-side for the validation of the latter with the help of the former is core to [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s claim of credibility. Therefore, and in order to make the editions accessible to readers with as little overhead as possible, we adapted the [[TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate](http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/) to our needs([@fig:boilerplate]). [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate is based on the idea to directly render [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files in a user's web browser by using the built-in support for [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). This application of [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} allows to transform [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} into [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} on-the-fly and to tailor the structure and content of this [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} to the specific project needs. The [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} representation can then be styled with [CSS]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and interacted with through Javascript, just like any other webpage [@walsh2016TEIBoilerplate; @walsh2013TEIBoilerplate]. Our heavily modified adaptation of the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate stylesheets adds support for right-to-left scripts, the  side-by-side view of page images and text, a table of contents, browsing to neighbouring issues, stable links to articles, sections, and paragraphs, and  machine-actionable bibliographic metadata on the article level, in addition to the necessary support for the specific structural requirements of periodicals. Finally, we added a simple system to provide multiple localisations and most parts of the (simple) interface are available Arabic [@OpenArabicPE:boilerplate].

![Webview of [@oclc_1034545644-i_15-div_1.d2e634], which renders the XML from [@fig:bidi-xml].](/BachUni/publications/github/p0fb41f86/assets/figures/boilerplate_zuhur-v_2-i_4.png){#fig:boilerplate}

The most obvious advantage of rendering [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files locally on the reader's computer is the removal of dependencies on backend servers and internet connections. Editions can be downloaded, distributed through [USB]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} keys, and run locally. Generating reading copies adhoc and on-the-fly also removed the need to actively generate, maintain, and upload multiple derivative versions of our editions and guarantees that human readers will always see the latest version. 

Linking to digital facsimiles already available on the internet is the preferred option from our project's point of view as scanning, maintaining, and hosting large files is prohibitively expensive (If we were to produce our own facsimiles, I would recommend uploading them to the [Internet Archive][internetarchive], which also provides basic [IIIF]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} support).[^fn10] But it taxes the readers as linked online facsimiles require stable, fast and affordable internet connections: loading our webview for a single periodical issue of 56 pages requires 8MB even though [IIIF]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} allows us to limit the quality of images to grayscale and a width of 800dpi. A simple parameter setting, therefore, allows users to switch off loading of online facsimiles. Downloading images once and serving them  locally would be the preferred option but it will most likely violate user agreements, licences and copyright depending on vendors and jurisdictions. Nevertheless, such download is rather trivial as links to the digital facsimiles are an inherent part of the [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files' `<facsimile>` node.

## The infrastructure

Editions and tools are maintained on [GitHub](github). GitHub is a staple of the open-source software development and [DH]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} communities since 2008 [C.f. @Lawson+2013+GitHub101ProfHackerBlogs; @Massey+2013+GitHubAcademiaAnd; @Shaffer+2013+PushPullFork]. Built upon the open-source version control system `.git`, originally developed for the Linux kernel, GitHub provides an ever evolving infrastructure for collaborative editing, including issue trackers and wikis for documentation. In this environment each edit to our editions is transparently documented and credited to an individual contributor with their email address and a timestamp. Most importantly, GitHub is free to use for academics or as long as all code repositories are openly accessible to the public. This means that any reader spotting an error or omission can contribute their corrections, comments etc.. The only threshold to participation is registering a free GitHub account.   
Github also provides free hosting  for our editions through [[*GitHub Pages*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}][gh-pages].   

Full-text search across the entire corpus is a core feature most users will expect to see implemented. There are at least three distinct aspects to this feature none of which are easy to implement in a static environment. First, users will want any search to be aware of our corpus' structural mark-up. That is, any search should be able to return hits on a specific structural level, such as a volume, issue, section or article. Second, to evaluate a potentially large number of hits and because we are used to hegemonial search interfaces, users will want to see keywords in context ([KWIC]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}). Third, we expect search engines to be "smart" in the sense that are aware of linguistic peculiarities and allow for some orthographic and morphologic variance.

Distributing digital corpora of hundreds of periodical issues without a backend severely restricts the ability to search and browse across issues. String search on plain text files, such as [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, is, of course, a basic functionality of any personal computer's operating system and there are plenty of free and open solutions to leverage additional power for fine tuning queries through [XPath]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} or regular expression ([RegEx]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}). For an expert user, this solution will satisfy the first two demands once they downloaded the entire corpus. We will also gradually change our encoding scheme to one [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} file per article for each periodical issue completely marked-up in order to set a more useful default item level for file based search operations (these files will then be compiled into issues upon rendering by the webview). However, most users will not readily have the skills and tools for implementing this approach. We, therefore, turned to Google's [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) and Search Console. This requires a Google account and to link this account to the editions' [URL]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s, which, for various political and legal reasons, might not be an option for other projects. Once set up, the Programmable Search Engine causes Google to crawl and index all editions and provides a basic Javascript snippet to integrate a project specific Google search box into any website. Google is not aware of the [TEI XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} or its structure as it crawls the [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} page generated by the webview, but the Programmable Search Engine provides [KWIC]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and all the bells and whistles of Google's algorithmic power. Moving to one file per article will again improve the granularity of this approach.

Browsing and searching bibliographic metadata, on the other hand, can be easily implemented. The free and open reference manager [Zotero][zotero] is a staple of the DH community and beyond. Among many other things, Zotero allows to share an unlimited amount of bibliographic references for free through a feature called [*Groups*]{custom-style="Emphasis"}. Zotero also provides a well-documented [API]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} for uploading, updating, and accessing all data beyond the user interface. This allows us to build and maintain a bibliographic index by hosting references to all articles in our corpus in a project specific [Zotero Group][openarabicpe_zotero]. Each reference links to the relevant section in the periodical editions through a stable [URL]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}. Readers can, therefore, use both Zotero's web interface and the standalone client as a port of entry to the entire [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} corpus.


### Facilitating re-use through licenses

Within the academic framework we are operating in, we depend on explicit licences to facilitate the use and re-use of our data and tools.[^fn11] We share all scripts under a permissible [MIT licence][mit-license] whenever possible and we assume that the content of periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean before 1920 is in the public domain even under the most restrictive definitions (i.e. US copyright law)---this interpretation is explicitly shared by US-based vendors serving digital facsimiles. The enormous amount of human labour required for digitising cultural artefacts, on the other hand, is commonly actively hidden by vendors and users. Within academic historiography, for instance, extensive use of digital surrogates instead of the physical artefact and reliance on their affordances remains an open secreteverybody does it but only few acknowledge this practice. This is evidenced by [a search on [JSTOR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}](https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicResults?Query=shamela.ws) for references to the [URL]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s of works from [al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"} in academic texts, which returned a grand total of only 16 journal articles and book chapters, some of which are shared with the 11 hits of a [search for "[al-Maktaba al-shāmila]{custom-style="Transcription"}"](https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22al-Maktaba+al-sh%C3%A3mila%22) [C.f. @Miller+2018, 104]. Reasons for this omission range from a distrust of the digital vaguely inspired by Benjamin's ideas on the loss of aura through mechanical reproduction of an artefact to perseverance of the established order of things and, ultimately, deception. Licences will not solve dishonest citation practices but retaining copyright of our own editorial contributions in the form of [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][cc-by-sa-4] is at least a reminder that all contributors need to be transparently credited for their work. 

# The challenges of bootstrapping


As has become clear from the above sections of this essay, the main advantages of bootstrapping is its reliance on open and free-to-use external services, tools, and data. This is also its greatest weakness as all these services, tools, and data are beyond our control. Every one of these dependencies will eventually break. The only question is when they will do so. Our  main mitigation strategies are open and widely supported standards to prevent lock-ins and loss of data, on the one hand, and a minimal software stack to keep the number of potential breaking points as small as possible, on the other. Mitigation strategies also depend on the evaluation of the relative importance of threats and components for the overarching goals of our project.

The data layer is at the core of the project. Once modelling and editing of a periodical issue in [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is complete, this part of the data layer will remain fairly stable. This stability is documented by versioned [*releases*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} of our editions at GitHub. Such versioned editions protect users from the inevitable [*content drift*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} of digital editions and ascertains that a referenced edition hasn't been changed in the meantime [c.f. @Broyles+2020+DigitalEditionsAnd]. Github, however, is a commercial platform  owned by Microsoft since 2018. Like any other commercial platform, they might change their business model or go out of business altogether at any point in the future. 

GitHub and competing platforms for distributed version control are, therefore, no solution for sustainable, long-term access. Long-term preservation and accessibility  require costly continuous maintenance out of reach for projects, such as ours, which cannot afford to pay running costs for years to come. Publicly funded data repositories, on the other hand, guarantee the integrity and availability of data for the foreseeable future. [Zenodo][zenodo] is an open and free-to-use, EU-funded research data repository originally developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}) in Geneva. In addition to its core service of providing long-term archiving of digital data, Zenodo registers versioned [Digital Object Identifiers ([DOI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][doi] and integrates with various Open Science infrastructures, such as scholarly aggregators of metadata or [Open Researcher and Contributor [ID]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} ([ORCID]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})][orcid] for unambiguously identifying contributors. Zenodo also integrates with GitHub by automatically archiving each release of data and tools and recording all contributors as found in the `.git` repository. This makes it a perfect choice for our GitHub-centered workflow.

The combination of platforms for distributed version-control with public repositories provides the necessary accessibility and sustainability of our data layer. But our editions' claim to credibility builds on the linkage between textual editions and digital facsimiles. These links to externally hosted facsimiles are the most volatile component of the data layer and we already encountered three major instances of link rot. Two were caused by vendors moving servers and changing protocols: The British Library moved the Endangered Archives Programme to [IIIF]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} in 2017 and [Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya]{custom-style="Transcription"} moved to a new domain in 2019.  HathiTrust removed the facsimiles of Princeton's copy of [al-Haqāʾiq]{custom-style="Transcription"} (vol.1, 1910) from the public domain without any explanation in 2016.[^fn12] Such link rot inevitably requires a lot of manual labour to figure out the patterns in new [URL]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s (if any) and to write the necessary scripts to update all [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files. Derivative formats, such as bibliographic metadata, although part of the data layer and preserved on Zenodo, can easily be regenerated from the main [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files whenever changes to the infrastructure or updated standards necessitate it.

The World Wide Web and web browsers are a fluid environment, which will gradually break the presentation layer. As it depends on specific versions of software, standards, and infrastructures, its functionality and looks cannot readily be preserved and archived.   [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate was the only viable option to render [TEI ]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files in the browser without a backend in 2015 and it still works.  All major browsers still support [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} transformation but with two limitations: First, [JSON]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} (JavaScript Object Notation) has in many cases superseded [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} as an exchange format for serialised (structured) data and [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} support is limited to version 1, which had been superseded by [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} 2 in 2007 and [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} 3 in 2017. If (!) browsers continue to support [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}, it won't be further developed. Second, browser vendors tighten the screws on security. Running [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} transformations on local files is considered attempted cross-site scripting and, consequently, aborted by Google's Chrome. Firefox will transform local [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files but only with remotely hosted [XSLT]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}. At the time of writing, only Apple's Safari allows for rendering our editions without any internet connection. On the other hand, the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} community has spawned new and exciting infrastructures for presenting [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}-based editions to human readers. Based on the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Processing Model [@Turska.etal+2016+ChallengingTheMyth], the [[TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Publisher][tei_publisher] provides a flexible publication and editing framework as long as one has access to hosted server space. The Javascript-based [[CETEIcean]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}][ceteicean], on the other hand, has matured into an alternative to [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} Boilerplate with the full support of the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} consortium [@cayless2020CETEIcean; @cayless2018CETEIceanTEIBrowser]. All future developments of [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}'s webview will therefore move to [CETEIcean]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}.

Hosting the webview is not a challenge in itself. There will always be services that provide hosting for such a small amount of data as our digital editions ([@tbl:corpus]) for free. They are, however, of varying convenience. Data might need to be copied from the code repository to the hosting provider. In this regard, GitHub pages is certainly the most convenient solution. It allows to directly  serve the [TEI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} files from any branch of the code repositories, ensuring that the presentation layer always renders the latest version of the data layer. 
Switching providers will introduce a major instance of [*link rot*]{custom-style="Emphasis"} for users of our editions. As a bare minimum, all [URL]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}s pointing from the bibliographic metadata to the editions will need to be updated. Renting a project specific domain, such as `ourproject.org`, will protect against such basic link rot for a small monthly fee, but it might require a credit card with the ability to transfer USD abroad, which is not necessarily available to projects across the Eastern Mediterranean. We have therefore decided to stick with the default domain provided by GitHub (`ourproject.github.io`).

# Conclusion

This paper introduced our project Open Arabic Periodical Editions as a concrete proposal for addressing the multiple layers of inaccessibility for the textual cultural heritage of the predominantly Arabic speaking societies of the Eastern Mediterranean through bootstrapping existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework for producing and distributing open scholarly periodical editions. This framework addresses  the constrains of material resisting digitisation and operates within the socio-technical affordances of a particular region of the Global South. The problems and practical approaches outlined above are, to a large extent, not specific to digital editions of Arabic periodicals or the particular environment in Lebanon. All tools, workflows, and infrastructures can be readily adapted to other literary genres in different scripts and languages with very little effort. Documenting our approaches and workflows are a major and ongoing contribution to this effort. 

With regards of project specific outcomes, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} has the potential to radically alter influence an emerging field of Arab Periodical Studies through making this material accessible to computational methods [@Grallert+2020]. The editions have been used as the necessary ground truth in first efforts to train genre-specific models for machine-learning approaches to [OCR]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} with very promising results in collaboration with Sinai Rusinek. Planned collaborations for improving layout-recognition algorithms will help to eventually remove the dependency on human transcribers and bring the digitisation of the rich Arabic textual heritage on par with at least the smaller Western languages. 

Beyond building infrastructures "without the help we can't get" [@Gil+2016, 29], [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} highlights how little effort is frequently needed to improve existing infrastructures. Oftentimes, adding basic support for the `@xml:lang` and `@lang` attributes to [XML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} and [HTML]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} environments with a little [CSS]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} snipped significantly improves their usability. Lobbying browser vendors to include a few lines to this end in their default CSS seems to be a worthwhile and achievable goal.In less optimistic terms, [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} contributes to laying open the brutal neo-colonial character of our contemporary knowledge infrastructures and digital economies. Character and text encoding standards, natural language processing and named entity recognition, ontologies, thesauri, and gazetteers (whether part of the semantic web or not) have all been developed without consideration of and input from the majority of human societies. [OpenArabicPE]{custom-style="Abbreviation"} is part of larger communities of practitioners that gravitate towards but are in no way limited to the [RTL conference](https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/) at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute ([DHSI]{custom-style="Abbreviation"}), the [Digital Humanities Institute --- Beirut ([DHIB]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})](https://dhibeirut.wordpress.com/), the [Islamicate Digital Humanities Network ([IDHN]{custom-style="Abbreviation"})](https://idhn.org/), the [Digital Orientalist](https://digitalorientalist.com/), or the [Historical Middle East Data Alliance][histme] . Together, we are raising attention for the needs of Arabic-centered scholarship and right-to-left scripts more general within the larger digital humanities environment.
