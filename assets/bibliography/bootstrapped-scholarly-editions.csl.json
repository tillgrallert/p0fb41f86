This tradition was maintained under the Soviet administration, with the result that today libraries in Baku and Azerbaijan boast an extensive and unique collection of books, manuscripts, newspapers and other serials from the Persian- and Turkic-speaking areas of the Caucasus and Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Ottoman Empire and the Arab world. The newspapers and serials held in these collections - largely in Ottoman, Azeri, Arabic, Persian, Uzbek and Urdu - include rare materials which until now have remained unknown to the majority of scholars working in the field of modern Middle Eastern history. This comprehensive catalogue provides information on newspapers in 16 languages and published between the 1870s and the early 1990s. It is a unique research tool for all specialists in the field.","author":[{"family":"Atabaki","given":"Touraj"},{"family":"Rustămova-Tohidi","given":"Solmaz"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"1-85043-836-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"English","note":"uuid: 14BA91A0-E443-4274-A00C-07FA2B20CDC8","publisher":"Tauris Academic Studies","publisher-place":"London","title":"Baku documents: union catalogue of Persian, Azerbaijani, Ottoman Turkish and Arabic serials and newspapers in the libraries of the Republic of Azerbaijan","title-short":"Baku documents","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Dobson+2019","abstract":"\"Can established humanities methods coexist with computational thinking? It is one of the major questions in humanities research today, as scholars increasingly adopt sophisticated data science for their work. James E. Dobson explores the opportunities and complications faced by humanists in this new era. Though the study and interpretation of texts alongside sophisticated computational tools can serve scholarship, these methods cannot replace existing frameworks. As Dobson shows, ideas of scientific validity cannot easily nor should be adapted for humanities research because digital humanities, unlike science, lack a leading-edge horizon charting the frontiers of inquiry. Instead, the methods of digital humanities require a constant rereading. At the same time, suspicious and critical readings of digital methodologies make it unwise for scholars to defer to computational methods. Humanists must examine the tools--including the assumptions that went into the codes and algorithms--and questions surrounding their own use of digital technology in research. Insightful and forward thinking, this book lays out a new path of humanistic inquiry that merges critical theory and computational science\"--","author":[{"family":"Dobson","given":"James E"}],"event-place":"Urbana","ISBN":"978-0-252-05111-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"English","note":"oclc: 1096281560\nuuid: 8BE0730A-E905-4FDC-8A3E-58E9B1C236B1","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","publisher-place":"Urbana","title":"Critical digital humanities: The search for a methodology","title-short":"Critical digital humanities","type":"book"},

Because of differences in national laws, data produced and legally reusable in one country can be unprocessable in another. Therefore, ready-made licenses have become a powerful tool to facilitate digital research on an international scale. This paper discusses the concept of copyright in the context of global laws that make open licenses vital for ensuring the sustainability of (digital) research data. Three types of ready-made licenses (Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, and Digital Peer Publishing Licenses) and their specific strengths are examined. Finally, the history of the transformation of the abstracts of the 2016 TEI Conference and Members' Meeting will serve as an example to show what proper licensing can do to push the research process.","author":[{"family":"Hannesschläger","given":"Vanessa"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative","DOI":"10/gg3wts","event-place":"","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 403C9996-B4D3-4395-AD1F-DD1AFF43818A","number":"11","publisher":"Text Encoding Initiative Consortium","publisher-place":"","title":"Common Creativity International: CC-Licensing and Other Options for TEI-Based Digital Editions in an International Context","title-short":"Common Creativity International","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Losh+2019","abstract":"# publisher's abstract<br>In recent years, the digital humanities has been shaken by important debates about inclusivity and scope—but what change will these conversations ultimately bring about? Can the digital humanities complicate the basic assumptions of tech culture, or will this body of scholarship and practices simply reinforce preexisting biases? <i>Bodies of Information</i> addresses this crucial question by assembling a varied group of leading voices, showcasing feminist contributions to a panoply of topics, including ubiquitous computing, game studies, new materialisms, and cultural phenomena like hashtag activism, hacktivism, and campaigns against online misogyny.<br>Taking intersectional feminism as the starting point for doing digital humanities, <i>Bodies of Information</i> is diverse in discipline, identity, location, and method. Helpfully organized around keywords of materiality, values, embodiment, affect, labor, and situatedness, this comprehensive volume is ideal for classrooms.

Conclusion<br><br># publisher's abstract<br>From the upheavals of recent national elections to the success of the #MyDressMyChoice feminist movement, digital platforms have already had a dramatic impact on political life in Kenya 2013 one of the most electronically advanced countries in Africa. While the impact of the Digital Age on Western politics has been extensively debated, there is still little appreciation of how it has been felt in developing countries such as Kenya, where Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other online platforms are increasingly a part of everyday life. Written by a respected Kenyan activist and researcher at the forefront of political online struggles, this book presents a unique contribution to the debate on digital democracy. For traditionally marginalised groups, particularly women and people with disabilities, digital spaces have allowed Kenyans to build new communities which transcend old ethnic and gender divisions. But the picture is far from wholly positive. Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics explores the drastic efforts being made by elites to contain online activism, as well as how 2018fake news2019, a failed digital vote-counting system and the incumbent president's recruitment of Cambridge Analytica contributed to tensions around the 2017 elections.

The chapter will focus on the development of the digital divide, explaining how it is not the simple access to the Internet itself (first level of digital divide) that determines digital inequalities, but rather the motivations, skills, and purpose of use (second level of digital divide) that influence online inequalities. The chapter goes beyond the binary approach of ‘have’ and ‘have not’, by introducing and discussing the third level of digital divide, seen as the social and cultural benefits deriving from accessing and using the Internet, stressing how social and digital inequalities are intertwined. The third level of digital divide focuses on the social consequences of Internet usage and it moves away the focus from the digital arena, by addressing it as a social issue.<br># critique<br>- doesn't mention knowledge of languages, and particularly knowledge of English, as impeding access","author":[{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"container-title":"Mapping the digital divide in Africa: A mediated analysis","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72.6","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-94-6298-685-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"oclc: 1090685704\nuuid: 02744793-A893-4FEC-A2DA-8C2AAB36508E","page":"27-44","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Conceptualising the digital divide","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"teiconsortium2020TEIP5Guidelines","abstract":"TEI P5 version 4.0.0 Release 4.0.0 is codenamed ‘Galileo’ in honor of Galileo's arrival to Rome on 13 February 1633 to face the Inquisition. We associate Galileo with decentering the earth in official western dogma of the universe. Similarly, the stand-off model in this release of the TEI Guidelines may serve to decenter our models of digital texts and expand our frames of reference. With the addition of standOff, a significant change in how characters outside of Unicode are described, and the ability of TEI to self-nest, this version is significantly different than previous versions, and thus deserves an increase in the “major” release number. In addition to the stand-off model, this release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 4.0.0 milestone. The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release:  The standOff element functions as a container element for linked data, contextual information, and stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI document (#374, thanks to Laurent Romary and Piotr Bański). With the introduction of the standOff element a new structural class model.describedResource has been introduced, and model.resourceLike has been revised and renamed model.resource. As the TEI element is a member of the new model.describedResource class, it can now be a child of another TEI element. The new standOff element:  is a child of TEI (or teiCorpus); may contain stand-off annotations, for example morphosyntactic annotations encoded with spanGrp or annotationBlock; may contain stand-off markup, for example a series of certainty, linkGrp, or alt elements; may contain contextual information, for example listPerson and listPlace; may contain information that must be pointed to from elsewhere, but is not found in the source document, for example a castList that represents characters who speak in a drama, but whose roles are not listed in the source document's printed cast list. New elements, attributes, and an attribute class have been introduced for using Unihan properties in TEI (#1805, thanks to Duncan Paterson):  The attribute class att.gaijiProp provides attributes for defining the properties of non-standard characters or glyphs.  The name attribute provides the name of the character or glyph property being defined. The value attribute provides the value of the character or glyph property being defined. The version attribute specifies the version number of the Unicode Standard in which this property name is defined. A list of suggested values is provided. The localProp element provides a locally defined character (or glyph) property. The unicodeProp element provides a Unicode property for a character (or glyph). The unihanProp element holds the name and value of a normative or informative Unihan character (or glyph) property as part of its attributes. A list of legal values from the Unicode Han Database is provided for the name attribute on unihanProp. The use of the elements charProp, charName, localName, unicodeName, and value has been deprecated. Changes were made to improve the precision of language in the Guidelines referring to conformance (#1588) Multiple Schematron rules, assertions, or reports in a single constraintSpec are now correctly output as a single sch:pattern in the RELAX NG schemas (#1625). The discussion of validation has been updated in A Gentle Introduction to XML (#1708). The attributes mode and ident have been added to the remarks element (#1713). The elements decoNote, explicit, and incipit are now members of the model.biblPart class (#1784). The description of the points attribute in att.coordinated has been clarified (#1789). The xr element is now a member of the attribute class att.typed (#1810). Our use of the Travis continuous integration server has been migrated from travis.org to travis.com (#1826). An example to specify the source of a translation has been added (#1830). The description of manuscript descriptions clarifies that msDesc can be used for all text-bearing objects (#1835). The content model of repository, institution, and collection has been changed from macro.xtext to macro.phraseSeq.limited (#1836). The g element is now available within the zone element (#1838). The placeName element has been added to the class model.settingPart and the example in the setting element has been changed accordingly (#1842). The dateline element is now a member of the class model.pLike.front (#1843). The catDesc element is now a member of the attribute class att.canonical (#1864). A Schematron rule has been added to only allow one remarks element per language in specification files (#1872). The datatype of the name attribute of the attRef element has been changed from teidata.text to teidata.name (#1878). The schema has been tightened to prevent a combination of valList in sequence with other members of model.contentPart (#1862). With the addition of the subtype attribute to the attribute class att.textCritical, subtype is now available on lem, rdg, and rdgGrp (#1867). The content model of teiCorpus has been changed (#1922). The constraints for teidata.word have been loosened to allow any character except Unicode separators or control characters (#1930). The explanation of Relax NG and XPath, together with its associated graphic in the chapter A Gentle Introduction to XML have been revised (#1949). Corrections of typographic errors and broken links, improvements on explanations, and corrections of examples have been conducted in various sections of the Guidelines (including #1760, #1847, #1887, #1907, #1909, #1927, #1936, #1948, #1952, #1954, #1964, #1965, #1968, #1969). Furthermore, a number of translations have been added or updated. In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 7.49.0 milestone. Highlights of this release include:  The type attribute on biblScope has been replaced by the unit attribute in the tests (#213). Orphaned files in the test directory have been removed (#216). Relative paths to CSS files in the EPUB transformation have been replaced with absolute paths (#312). The jquery library has been updated (#359). Special characters encoded as <w:sym> in DOCX are now converted to hi elements (#389). Correct handling of Schematron rules in attDef elements (#403 and #1950). Finally, we have made some significant updates to our documentation and the website:  Documentation of Council practices in TCW 20 is improved for working with branches in the TEIC GitHub repository #1825. The documentation for updating the TEI Framework in oXygen to the latest release of the TEI Guidelines has been improved #1673 and added to the oxygen-tei repository, see How to automatically update your TEI framework in oXygen. Corrections have been conducted in various sections of the TEI website (including #1944), and #1938.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]]},"author":[{"literal":"TEI Consortium"}],"DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.3413524","genre":"XML","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,13]]},"publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange","title-short":"TEI P5","type":"book","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/3667251","version":"4.0.0"},
  {"id":"Thylstrup+2018","abstract":"# case studies<br>- google books<br>- europeana<br># publisher's abstract<br>\"Today, anyone with an internet connection can access hundreds of millions of digitized cultural artifacts from the comfort of their desk. And every day cultural institutions and private bodies add thousands of new cultural works to the digital sphere. Mass digitization is forming new central nexuses of knowledge and new ways of engaging with that knowledge. What at first glance appears to be a simple act of digitization (a transformation of singular books from boundary objects to open sets of data), at closer examination reveals a complex process teeming with diverse political, legal, and cultural investments. This book argues that mass digitization has become a global cultural political project. It offers an in-depth examination of mass digitization of cultural memory in the West and beyond. It suggests a new approach to the study of digital cultural memory archives, proposing to understand mass digitization not as neutral technical processes, but rather as distinct subpolitical processes that build new kinds of archives and new ways of interacting with these archives. And it seeks to develop a critical theoretical framework for understanding the new archival apparatuses and the politics and memory dynamics they give rise to.\"--","author":[{"family":"Thylstrup","given":"Nanna Bonde"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-262-03901-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"oclc: 1090427862\nuuid: 1BFA26C9-9432-45A5-8151-C919CAEE9260","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"The politics of mass digitization","type":"book"},

  {"id":"tunink2017AnnotoniaAnnotationsBrowser","abstract":"The Willa Cather Archive (WCA) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) is currently working on transcription and annotation of 1500 letters to be released in 2018. As editors will write several thousand annotations, the workflow logistics are complicated. Annotonia1 is a solution developed within the Center for Digital Research in Humanities (CDRH) that allows editors to write annotations directly on letters in a browser and insert those annotations into Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML files. Multiple editors review annotations, track letters’ annotation statuses, and generate a new TEI file incorporating the annotations, avoiding having to manually edit each file. Annotonia utilizes both pre-existing, customized open source software and new software developed for this project. This paper describes the difficulties faced, the workflow of Annotonia, and its prospects for future annotation work.","author":[{"family":"Tunink","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Dalziel","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Dussault","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Rau","given":"Emily"}],"container-title":"Digital Humanities 2017","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"language":"en","title":"Annotonia: Annotations from Browser to TEI","title-short":"Annotonia","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/488/488.pdf"},
