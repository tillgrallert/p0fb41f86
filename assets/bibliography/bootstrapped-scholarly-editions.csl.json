In addition, this paper proposes a standard protocol with a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) systems to assist researchers in comparing different Arabic OCR approaches. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an experiment to automatically evaluate four well-known Arabic OCR systems using a set of performance metrics. The evaluation experiment is conducted on a publicly available printed Arabic dataset comprising 240 text images with a variety of resolution levels, font types, font styles and font sizes. Findings The experimental results show that the field of character recognition for printed Arabic still requires further research to reach an efficient text recognition method for Arabic script. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive automated evaluation of Arabic OCR systems with respect to the characteristics of Arabic script and, in addition, proposes an evaluation methodology that can be used as a benchmark by researchers and therefore will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field of Arabic script recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Mansoor"},{"family":"Teahan","given":"William"}],"container-title":"PSU Research Review","DOI":"10/gh4457","ISSN":"2399-1747","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210902092554/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026/full/html","number":"3","page":"229-241","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Experimental evaluation of Arabic OCR systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"Alkaoud.Syed+2020+OnTheImportance","abstract":"Arabic, like other highly inflected languages, encodes a large amount of information in its morphology and word structure. In this work, we propose two embedding strategies that modify the tokenization phase of traditional word embedding models (Word2Vec) and contextual word embedding models (BERT) to take into account Arabic's relatively complex morphology. In Word2Vec, we segment words into subwords during training time and then compose word-level representations from the subwords during test time. We train our embeddings on Arabic Wikipedia and show that they perform better than a Word2Vec model on multiple Arabic natural language processing datasets while being approximately 60% smaller in size. Moreover, we showcase our embeddings' ability to produce accurate representations of some out-of-vocabulary words that were not encountered before. In BERT, we modify the tokenization layer of Google's pretrained multilingual BERT model by incorporating information on morphology. By doing so, we achieve state of the art performance on two Arabic NLP datasets without pretraining.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Alkaoud","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Syed","given":"Mairaj"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Fifth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop","event":"COLING-WANLP 2020","event-place":"Barcelona, Spain (Online)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210824114827/https://aclanthology.org/2020.wanlp-1.11/","page":"119–129","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Barcelona, Spain (Online)","source":"ACLWeb","title":"On the Importance of Tokenization in Arabic Embedding Models","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.wanlp-1.11"},

This article argues that producers of digital editions should assign meaningful version numbers to their editions and update those version numbers with each change, allowing both humans and computers to know when resources have been modified and how significant the changes are. As an examination of versioning practices in the software industry reveals, version numbers are not neutral descriptors but social products intended for use in specific contexts, and the producers of digital editions must consider how version numbers will be used in developing numbering schemes. It may be beneficial to version different parts of an edition separately, and in particular to version the data objects or content of an edition independently from the environment in which it is displayed. The article concludes with a case study of the development of a versioning policy for the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and includes an appendix surveying how a selection of digital editions handle the problem of recording and communicating changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Broyles","given":"Paul A."}],"container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","DOI":"10.17613/bde5-rp28","ISSN":"1938-4122","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en-US","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210913132015/https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:38103/","publisher":"Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations","source":"hcommons.org","title":"Digital Editions and Version Numbering","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000455/000455.html","volume":"14"},

As Dobson shows, ideas of scientific validity cannot easily nor should be adapted for humanities research because digital humanities, unlike science, lack a leading-edge horizon charting the frontiers of inquiry. Instead, the methods of digital humanities require a constant rereading. At the same time, suspicious and critical readings of digital methodologies make it unwise for scholars to defer to computational methods.

  {"id":"ElShamsy+2020+RediscoveringTheIslamic","abstract":"\"Historians have traced the traditions of Islamic scholarship back to late antiquity. Muslim scholars were at work as early as 750 CE/AD, painstakingly copying their commentaries and legal opinions onto scrolls and codices. This venerable tradition embraced the modern printing press relatively late-movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century. Islamic scholars, however, initially kept their distance from the new technology, and it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the first published editions of works of classical religious scholarship began to appear in print. As the culture of print took root, both popular and scholarly understandings of the Islamic tradition shifted. Particular religious works were soon read precisely because they were available in printed, published editions. Other equally erudite works still in scroll and manuscript form, by contrast, languished in the obscurity of manuscript repositories. The people who selected, edited, and published the new print books on and about Islam exerted a huge influence on the resulting literary tradition. These unheralded editors determined, essentially, what came to be understood by the early twentieth century as the classical written \"canon\" of Islamic thought. Collectively, this relatively small group of editors who brought Islamic literature into print crucially shaped how Muslim intellectuals, the Muslim public, and various Islamist movements understood the Islamic intellectual tradition. In this book Ahmed El Shamsy recounts this sea change, focusing on the Islamic literary culture of Cairo, a hot spot of the infant publishing industry, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As El Shamsy argues, the aforementioned editors included some of the greatest minds in the Muslim world and shared an ambitious intellectual agenda of revival, reform, and identity formation.

  {"id":"Fiormonte.etal+2015+ThePoliticsof","abstract":"1. Introduction Digital languages and instruments are not only powerful tools for simplifying and enhancing the work of humanists and social scientists, they also create new cultural representations and self-representations that transform both the epistemology and the practice of research.\nIn particular, digital representations can influence and shape our cultural artefacts and everyday experiences in various ways. For example, we are influenced in the way we represent everyday digital objects, such as the Windows folder as a metaphor for &lsquo;document box&rsquo;. This is at the level of the interfaces that &lsquo;produce users through benign interactions [&hellip;]. That is, as ideology create subjects, interactive and seemingly real-time interfaces create users who believe they are the &ldquo;source&rdquo; of the computer&rsquo;s action&rsquo; (Chun 2011: 66-68). We are also influenced by the ways in which we write software or encode a document through specific languages (e.g. &nbsp;Python or HTML). However, it is easy to demonstrate that such a distinction is artificial (and often damaging). From a semiotic point of view, both representations (visible interface and invisible coding) are &lsquo;modelling systems&rsquo; (Uspenskij et al. 1973) that cast their influence on overlapping political, social, cognitive and epistemological domains. In the first case we are talking about an influence mainly on practices and processes (social and cognitive dimensions), and in the second case we are dealing with the theory and interpretation of information structures (linguistic, hermeneutical and epistemological dimensions).\nIn our paper we will focus on this second aspect, and show some examples of how code and encodings are shaping the way we conceive and practise the work of reconstruction, conservation and representation of information structures and cultural artefacts. To this aim, we will discuss three encoding tools widely used in the Humanities and Social Sciences communities: HTML, the de facto standard for encoding World Wide Web documents and pages, Unicode, an industry standard designed to allow text and symbols from all of the writing systems of the world to be consistently represented and manipulated by computers, and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which defines a set of rules for encoding documents.\n2. HTML War\nThe evolution of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as a structural language and application standard of the World Wide Web has been largely shaped by forces outside of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international community assembled by Tim Berners-Lee &lsquo;to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.&rsquo; (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/)\nEven before it became a W3C Recommendation on October 28, 2014, HTML5 had already reached in 2009 the status of a de facto standard on the Web. This was promoted and encouraged by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a community established by Apple, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software (joined later by Google) that was in open opposition to the development of the language of the Web as envisioned by the W3C and &lsquo;concerned about the W3C&rsquo;s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world authors.&rsquo; (https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F)\nAs in the days of the browser wars between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer (Sordi 2010), tensions collide (and versions are released) around the code of the World Wide Web that appear to be inspired by benefits for the authors and the users of the Web, but in in fact were tied to strategies to control a market that Web 2.0 apps, social media and the eternal promise of the Semantic Web have once again enhanced (Zeldman - Marcotte 2010).\nControlling the development of HTML means controlling the competition between the different software used to access the Web (Ford 2014); managing the scheduling and release of mobile applications that can now compete at the same level as desktop applications, without being forced to adopt or implement competing solutions; and to determine how texts and information on the Web can be searched and placed interrelated, making the definitive migration from a Web based on document search to a system for collecting user data. In other words, behind the HTML war there is a growing obsession by industry and governments with our digital traces, habits and personal information (Lyon &ndash; Bauman 2013; Bowker 2013).\n3. The cultural and political biases of XML\nA markup language permits us to formally describe the structure of a text, and to analyse the data in depth. Its utility will be in proportion to how much information it can set out, include and preserve. The word &lsquo;markup&rsquo; itself shows its original bias: ironically, like other computing languages, XML is one the most faithful successors to the Gutenberg model; its basic aim is to imitate and preserve structured information as laid out in modern printed books. But is hierarchical and structured information an inherent and universal feature of texts (let alone writing)? The bias inherited from print has forced us to think of a text as a stable product, but if we either look at the different historical representations of a given text or at its documented writing stages, it is clear that there is not one text, but as many different texts as there are mechanisms of writing, material production, intertextual paths and methodologies of reconstruction (Fiormonte &ndash; Schmidt &ndash; Martiradonna 2010). Not only there is a potential conflict between the linear and hierarchical nature of current markup languages, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process, current text encoding tools and methodologies seems to constitute the most serious obstacle to the development of an independent theory of digital text.\nA typical example of the overlapping between geopolitical settings and technical choices can be found in organisations like the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), an international consortium that defines guidelines for encoding cultural heritage documents in XML. However, the practice of defining encoding standards to allow electronic documents to be processed ultimately by shared software at the presentation level, does not work nearly as well for the encoding of historical primary sources (Schmidt 2014). Attempts to declare &lsquo;standard&rsquo; names for textual features overlook significant variations in the interpretation, selection and application of those codes by different groups, individuals and cultures. Once again, the &lsquo;practice&rsquo; of code is the result of the &lsquo;theory&rsquo; reflected by certain groups and interests. Encoding tools and methodologies become examples of &lsquo;symbolic capital&rsquo; (Bourdieu 1984) used by the TEI community to &nbsp;export a universalising, western-centric approach to the representation of cultural artefacts.\n4. Universalizing the typography: Unicode &nbsp;\nThe Unicode standard aims at constituting a universal and inclusive mapping of all graphemes from existing and past writing systems. Yet, some assumptions that underlie the standard are shaped by the culture-specific standardisation of the graphical representation of language generated by Gutenberg&rsquo;s invention of moveable type printing.\nThe Unicode writing system, now forced upon all scripts, is based on a discrete ordered sequence of individual characters flowing only in one direction and dimension. However, in many writing systems based on handwriting, including contemporary Arabic and some Indic scripts, some graphemes &lsquo;orbit&rsquo; around a central grapheme and can be written not only after (left or right, depending on the main direction of the script), but also before, above or under the &lsquo;main&rsquo; grapheme. This is the case of ancient Greek &lsquo;hypogegrammenon (subscribed) iota&rsquo;, written before another vowel if lowercase, but after that vowel if uppercase. A wider case study is provided by the right-to-left Indic scripts where some vowels, although pronounced after a consonant, may be written before it (The Unicode Consortium 2014, chapter 12.1; Perri 2009; Constable 2001, II, par. 6.3).\nAnother assumption underlying the Unicode model is a one-to-one correspondence between phoneme and grapheme. The European medieval handwriting conventions based on the Greek or Latin alphabets are an interesting case study in this respect: ligatures, brevigraphs (sometimes represented by apparent diacritics such as macrons) and logographs are systematic and &lsquo;regular&rsquo; here, and the underlying model is incompatible with the Unicode/Gutenberg one-to-one correspondence between a phoneme and a character in a linear sequence. However, the XML/TEI Guidelines for the transcription of pre-modern primary sources simply recommend the use of Unicode for this purpose (TEI P5 Guidelines, chapter 5).\nIn all these cases, the current version of Unicode imposes the Gutenberg model (based on the Latin alphabet used in Europe in the Modern Age) upon writing systems based on different models, and all discrepancies are treated as &lsquo;exceptions&rsquo; to be dealt with at the presentational rendering level through software workarounds.\n5. Conclusions\nThese case studies show that digital &lsquo;standards&rsquo; always reflect a cultural bias (Carey 2009), and that the level of encoding is never neutral, but tends to assume (and overlap with) universalising discourses that are usually invisible at the surface of technology (Galloway 2012).\nDigital Universalism (Chan 2014) is deeply intertwined with the question of language, which in its turn controls our encoding practices. Code imperialism and linguistic imperialism (Phillipson 2009) are two sides of the same coin. We are facing a codex universalis, based on the English lingua franca, used to articulate and exert a power of &nbsp;standardisation and control.\nBut codes and encoding(s) before or along &lsquo;semiotic&rsquo;, &lsquo;hermeneutic&rsquo; or &lsquo;cultural&rsquo; are also political phenomena. &nbsp;Looking at boards, offices and steering committees reveals that consortia, associations and organisations like Unicode, ICANN , TEI or the W3C are informed by Anglophone hegemonies, and their decisions are shaped by their commercial interests, ideologies and cultures. So apparently &lsquo;neutral&rsquo;, &lsquo;technical&rsquo; decisions, as can be observed in Unicode, TEI or other organisations, tend to oversimplify and standardise the complex diversity of languages and cultural artefacts.\nAs Friedrich Kittler put it: &lsquo;Codes&mdash;by name and by matter&mdash;are what determine us today, and what we must articulate if only to avoid disappearing under them completely. &hellip; Today, technology puts code into the practice of realities, that is to say: it encodes the world&rsquo; (Kittler 2008: 40). &nbsp;So, is it still in our power to code (encode reality), or rather is code imposing on us its biases and constraints?\nIn the conclusion of our presentation we will try to propose solutions to avoid or reduce the impact of universalistic encoding, and report on alternative experiences and experiments that try to resist the effects of &lsquo;colonial computing&rsquo; (Ali 2014).References\nAli, Mustafa (2014). &ldquo;Towards a decolonial computing&rdquo;, CEPE 2013: Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry, 1-3 July 2013, Lisbon, Portugal, International Society of Ethics and Information Technology, pp. 28&ndash;35.\nBauman, Zygmunt and Lyon, David (2013).

  {"id":"GonzalezMartinez.Milo+2020+ANewStrategy","abstract":"OCR has seen major improvements in recent years, even though conventional OCR strategies don’t yet exploit linguistic concepts on Arabic script analysis. We present a new, additional strategy that aims to enhance Arabic OCR. In this approach A. disambiguating dots are temporarily eliminated, which reduces classes of graphemes sharing the same base element to single archigraphemes and B. contextual behaviour of Arabic archigraphemes is redefined as fusing: archigraphemes merge unrecognizably into letter blocks according to a rule-based system called script grammar. The letter block is defined as the minimum unit of Arabic script formation. E.g., the word بحوث consists of two letter blocks, groups of fused allographs surrounded by graphic space, ٮحو and ٮ (BGW B). From an Arabic corpus of circa 85 million words we extracted a list of circa 47,000 unique archigraphemic letter blocks, which implies that we reduced the generative, dynamic Arabic writing system to proportions of a static script like Chinese. We then show how to synthesise all theoretical shapes for each letter block from computer models of specific Islamic script styles (ruqʿä, naskh, nastaʿlīq). Only in the final stage, we would need to disambiguate the archigraphemes into actual graphemes using linguistic information, part of which we already gathered from the 85 million words corpus. This approach also makes initial OCR training possible on texts rendered with the very same Islamic script models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"González Martínez","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Milo","given":"Thomas"}],"container-title":"Égypte/Monde arabe","DOI":"10/gmsctp","ISBN":"9782900956229","ISSN":"1110-5097","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","number":"22","page":"21-30","publisher":"Centre d’études et de documentation économiques, juridiques et sociales (CEDEJ); https://web.archive.org/web/20210913121825/https://journals.openedition.org/ema/13146","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"A new strategy for Arabic OCR based on script analysis and synthesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.openedition.org/ema/13146","volume":"22"},

Because of differences in national laws, data produced and legally reusable in one country can be unprocessable in another. Therefore, ready-made licenses have become a powerful tool to facilitate digital research on an international scale. This paper discusses the concept of copyright in the context of global laws that make open licenses vital for ensuring the sustainability of (digital) research data. Three types of ready-made licenses (Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, and Digital Peer Publishing Licenses) and their specific strengths are examined. Finally, the history of the transformation of the abstracts of the 2016 TEI Conference and Members' Meeting will serve as an example to show what proper licensing can do to push the research process.","author":[{"family":"Hannesschläger","given":"Vanessa"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative","DOI":"10/gg3wts","event-place":"","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,6]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 403C9996-B4D3-4395-AD1F-DD1AFF43818A","number":"11","publisher":"Text Encoding Initiative Consortium","publisher-place":"","title":"Common Creativity International: CC-Licensing and Other Options for TEI-Based Digital Editions in an International Context","title-short":"Common Creativity International","type":"article-journal"},

We discuss the historical situation of OT text collections and how they were excluded for the most part from the late twentieth century corpora digitization that took place in many Latin script languages. This exclusion has two basic reasons: the technical challenges of OCR for Arabic script languages, and the rapid abandonment of that very script in the Turkish historical context. In the specific case of OT, opening periodical collections to digital tools require training HTR models to generate transcriptions in the Latin writing system of contemporary readers of Turkish, and not, as some may expect, in right-to-left Arabic script text. In the paper we discuss the challenges of training such models where one-to-one correspondence between the writing systems do not exist, and we report results based on our HTR experiments with two OT periodicals from the early twentieth century. Finally, we reflect on potential domain bias of HTR models in historical languages exhibiting spatio-temporal variance as well as the significance of working between writing systems for language communities that have experienced language reform and script change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirmizialtin","given":"Suphan"},{"family":"Wrisley","given":"David"}],"container-title":"arXiv:2011.01139 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,2]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Automated Transcription of Non-Latin Script Periodicals: A Case Study in the Ottoman Turkish Print Archive","title-short":"Automated Transcription of Non-Latin Script Periodicals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01139"},

Can the digital humanities complicate the basic assumptions of tech culture, or will this body of scholarship and practices simply reinforce preexisting biases? <i>Bodies of Information</i> addresses this crucial question by assembling a varied group of leading voices, showcasing feminist contributions to a panoply of topics, including ubiquitous computing, game studies, new materialisms, and cultural phenomena like hashtag activism, hacktivism, and campaigns against online misogyny.<br>Taking intersectional feminism as the starting point for doing digital humanities, <i>Bodies of Information</i> is diverse in discipline, identity, location, and method. Helpfully organized around keywords of materiality, values, embodiment, affect, labor, and situatedness, this comprehensive volume is ideal for classrooms. And with its multiplicity of viewpoints and arguments, it’s also an important addition to the evolving conversations around one of the fastest growing fields in the academy.<br># contributors<br>Babalola Titilola Aiyegbusi, U of Lethbridge; Moya Bailey, Northeastern U; Bridget Blodgett, U of Baltimore; Barbara Bordalejo, KU Leuven; Jason Boyd, Ryerson U; Christina Boyles, Trinity College; Susan Brown, U of Guelph; Lisa Brundage, CUNY; micha cárdenas, U of Washington Bothell; Marcia Chatelain, Georgetown U; Danielle Cole; Beth Coleman, U of Waterloo; T.

  {"id":"Milo.Martinez+2019+ANewStrategy","abstract":"Current OCR has limited capability for Arabic because of script models lacking scientific basis. We propose a new OCR strategy for Arabic, based on 1. Islamic script grammar including extended shaping and 2. treating Arabic script as a multi-layered writing system. We analyse Arabic script as an allographic rendering of graphemic abstractions. Grapheme is a term adapted from phonology; it is analogous to the term phoneme. In phonology, the smallest functional unit of sound is the phoneme. This is not heard, but perceived. What one hears are contextually conditioned allophones. In Arabic orthography, the smallest functional unit of spelling is the grapheme. This is not seen, but perceived. What one sees are contextually conditioned allographs. In our analysis, the letter block is the minimum unit of Arabic script formation and therefore of script grammar. A letter block is a single allograph or of a group of fused allographs surrounded by graphic space. The analogy with phonology can be pushed further: the archiphoneme is a bundle of shared features between two or more phonemes, minus their distinctive features. The archigrapheme is the bundle of shared features between two or more graphemes, minus their distinctive features. An archigraphemic letter block consists of one or more reduced allographs between spaces. The letter block follows the base line. There can be ligatures between letter blocks. In our strategy the archigraphemic letter block also forms the minimum unit of OCR. We have (1) implemented an algorithm that reduces any Unicode text in Arabic script to archigraphemes and we used it to create a list in Unicode format of all attested unique archigraphemic letter blocks on the internet. (2) With this list, and applying extended Islamic script grammar, we can synthesize realistic images of all possible archigraphemic fusions in a given style. These two developments make it possible to create an OCR system for recognizing synthetic Arabic under controlled conditions for both basic and extended shaping in a given style. These two steps result in competence, after which the OCR system should be trained to apply tolerance for the variation of performance in real documents. To interpret the identified letter blocks linguistically, a technique for the parsing of archigraphemes must be developed. For example, the single sequence of the three archigraphemic letter blocks EBD A LLH can be interpreted as several different surface texts such as abda-n li llaahi, abdu l-laahi and inda l-laahi. To facilitate the linguistic phase of the process, the same list of unique archigraphemic letter blocks is designed to identify the language of the text under scrutiny. In this phase we can present • Islamic script synthesis • Unicode conversion from plene orthography to archigraphemic transliteration • the archigraphemic search algorithm • the list of unique archigraphemic letter blocks • samples of authentic shape generation These are the first steps towards static OCR technology. The next step is to create or find matching AI software to teach OCR to recognize any unmapped letter blocks in order to make the OCR dynamic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Milo","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Martínez","given":"Alicia González"}],"collection-title":"DATeCH2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10/gmscgz","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7194-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210913115559/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3322905.3322928","page":"93–96","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A New Strategy for Arabic OCR: Archigraphemes, Letter Blocks, Script Grammar, and shape synthesis","title-short":"A New Strategy for Arabic OCR","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322905.3322928"},

While the impact of the Digital Age on Western politics has been extensively debated, there is still little appreciation of how it has been felt in developing countries such as Kenya, where Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other online platforms are increasingly a part of everyday life. Written by a respected Kenyan activist and researcher at the forefront of political online struggles, this book presents a unique contribution to the debate on digital democracy. For traditionally marginalised groups, particularly women and people with disabilities, digital spaces have allowed Kenyans to build new communities which transcend old ethnic and gender divisions. But the picture is far from wholly positive. Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics explores the drastic efforts being made by elites to contain online activism, as well as how 2018fake news2019, a failed digital vote-counting system and the incumbent president's recruitment of Cambridge Analytica contributed to tensions around the 2017 elections.

The chapter will focus on the development of the digital divide, explaining how it is not the simple access to the Internet itself (first level of digital divide) that determines digital inequalities, but rather the motivations, skills, and purpose of use (second level of digital divide) that influence online inequalities. The chapter goes beyond the binary approach of ‘have’ and ‘have not’, by introducing and discussing the third level of digital divide, seen as the social and cultural benefits deriving from accessing and using the Internet, stressing how social and digital inequalities are intertwined. The third level of digital divide focuses on the social consequences of Internet usage and it moves away the focus from the digital arena, by addressing it as a social issue.<br># critique<br>- doesn't mention knowledge of languages, and particularly knowledge of English, as impeding access","author":[{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"container-title":"Mapping the digital divide in Africa: A mediated analysis","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72.6","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-94-6298-685-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"oclc: 1090685704\nuuid: 02744793-A893-4FEC-A2DA-8C2AAB36508E","page":"27-44","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Conceptualising the digital divide","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Sahle+2016+WhatIsA","abstract":"This volume  presents the state of the art in digital scholarly editing. Drawing  together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives  pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer  a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing  and reading digital scholarly editions—and the theories that underpin  them.      The unrelenting progress of computer  technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most  fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use  to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have  all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches  these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind.  Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation  of the discipline—one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and  printed works from across literary history, and the globe.       The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing,  along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help  redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and  future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting  point for further scholarship. This collection is essential reading for  editors, scholars, students and readers who are invested in the future  of textual scholarship and the digital humanities.","author":[{"family":"Sahle","given":"Patrick"}],"container-title":"Digital Scholarly Editing: Theories and Practices","DOI":"10.11647/OBP.0095.002","editor":[{"family":"Driscoll","given":"Matthew James"},{"family":"Pierazzo","given":"Elena"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"1-78374-241-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 9D9EBEE5-EABC-4ED6-AEAF-4B90E45D1F83\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210506023824/https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/483/digital-scholarly-editing--theories-and-practices","page":"19-39","publisher":"Open Book Publishers","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"What is a Scholarly Digital Edition?","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/483/digital-scholarly-editing--theories-and-practices"},

  {"id":"Strubell.etal+2019+EnergyAndPolicy","abstract":"Recent progress in hardware and methodology for training neural networks has ushered in a new generation of large networks trained on abundant data. These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both ﬁnancially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate ﬁnancial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these ﬁndings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Strubell","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Ganesh","given":"Ananya"},{"family":"McCallum","given":"Andrew"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10/ggbgzx","event":"Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","event-place":"Florence, Italy","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"3645-3650","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Florence, Italy","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1355"},

  {"id":"teiconsortium2020TEIP5Guidelines","abstract":"TEI P5 version 4.0.0 Release 4.0.0 is codenamed ‘Galileo’ in honor of Galileo's arrival to Rome on 13 February 1633 to face the Inquisition. We associate Galileo with decentering the earth in official western dogma of the universe. Similarly, the stand-off model in this release of the TEI Guidelines may serve to decenter our models of digital texts and expand our frames of reference. With the addition of standOff, a significant change in how characters outside of Unicode are described, and the ability of TEI to self-nest, this version is significantly different than previous versions, and thus deserves an increase in the “major” release number. In addition to the stand-off model, this release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 4.0.0 milestone. The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release:  The standOff element functions as a container element for linked data, contextual information, and stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI document (#374, thanks to Laurent Romary and Piotr Bański). With the introduction of the standOff element a new structural class model.describedResource has been introduced, and model.resourceLike has been revised and renamed model.resource. As the TEI element is a member of the new model.describedResource class, it can now be a child of another TEI element. The new standOff element:  is a child of TEI (or teiCorpus); may contain stand-off annotations, for example morphosyntactic annotations encoded with spanGrp or annotationBlock; may contain stand-off markup, for example a series of certainty, linkGrp, or alt elements; may contain contextual information, for example listPerson and listPlace; may contain information that must be pointed to from elsewhere, but is not found in the source document, for example a castList that represents characters who speak in a drama, but whose roles are not listed in the source document's printed cast list. New elements, attributes, and an attribute class have been introduced for using Unihan properties in TEI (#1805, thanks to Duncan Paterson):  The attribute class att.gaijiProp provides attributes for defining the properties of non-standard characters or glyphs.  The name attribute provides the name of the character or glyph property being defined. The value attribute provides the value of the character or glyph property being defined. The version attribute specifies the version number of the Unicode Standard in which this property name is defined. A list of suggested values is provided. The localProp element provides a locally defined character (or glyph) property. The unicodeProp element provides a Unicode property for a character (or glyph). The unihanProp element holds the name and value of a normative or informative Unihan character (or glyph) property as part of its attributes. A list of legal values from the Unicode Han Database is provided for the name attribute on unihanProp. The use of the elements charProp, charName, localName, unicodeName, and value has been deprecated. Changes were made to improve the precision of language in the Guidelines referring to conformance (#1588) Multiple Schematron rules, assertions, or reports in a single constraintSpec are now correctly output as a single sch:pattern in the RELAX NG schemas (#1625). The discussion of validation has been updated in A Gentle Introduction to XML (#1708). The attributes mode and ident have been added to the remarks element (#1713). The elements decoNote, explicit, and incipit are now members of the model.biblPart class (#1784). The description of the points attribute in att.coordinated has been clarified (#1789). The xr element is now a member of the attribute class att.typed (#1810). Our use of the Travis continuous integration server has been migrated from travis.org to travis.com (#1826). An example to specify the source of a translation has been added (#1830). The description of manuscript descriptions clarifies that msDesc can be used for all text-bearing objects (#1835). The content model of repository, institution, and collection has been changed from macro.xtext to macro.phraseSeq.limited (#1836). The g element is now available within the zone element (#1838). The placeName element has been added to the class model.settingPart and the example in the setting element has been changed accordingly (#1842). The dateline element is now a member of the class model.pLike.front (#1843). The catDesc element is now a member of the attribute class att.canonical (#1864). A Schematron rule has been added to only allow one remarks element per language in specification files (#1872). The datatype of the name attribute of the attRef element has been changed from teidata.text to teidata.name (#1878). The schema has been tightened to prevent a combination of valList in sequence with other members of model.contentPart (#1862). With the addition of the subtype attribute to the attribute class att.textCritical, subtype is now available on lem, rdg, and rdgGrp (#1867). The content model of teiCorpus has been changed (#1922). The constraints for teidata.word have been loosened to allow any character except Unicode separators or control characters (#1930). The explanation of Relax NG and XPath, together with its associated graphic in the chapter A Gentle Introduction to XML have been revised (#1949). Corrections of typographic errors and broken links, improvements on explanations, and corrections of examples have been conducted in various sections of the Guidelines (including #1760, #1847, #1887, #1907, #1909, #1927, #1936, #1948, #1952, #1954, #1964, #1965, #1968, #1969). Furthermore, a number of translations have been added or updated. In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 7.49.0 milestone. Highlights of this release include:  The type attribute on biblScope has been replaced by the unit attribute in the tests (#213). Orphaned files in the test directory have been removed (#216). Relative paths to CSS files in the EPUB transformation have been replaced with absolute paths (#312). The jquery library has been updated (#359). Special characters encoded as <w:sym> in DOCX are now converted to hi elements (#389). Correct handling of Schematron rules in attDef elements (#403 and #1950). Finally, we have made some significant updates to our documentation and the website:  Documentation of Council practices in TCW 20 is improved for working with branches in the TEIC GitHub repository #1825. The documentation for updating the TEI Framework in oXygen to the latest release of the TEI Guidelines has been improved #1673 and added to the oxygen-tei repository, see How to automatically update your TEI framework in oXygen.

  {"id":"Thylstrup+2018","abstract":"# case studies<br>- google books<br>- europeana<br># publisher's abstract<br>\"Today, anyone with an internet connection can access hundreds of millions of digitized cultural artifacts from the comfort of their desk. And every day cultural institutions and private bodies add thousands of new cultural works to the digital sphere. Mass digitization is forming new central nexuses of knowledge and new ways of engaging with that knowledge. What at first glance appears to be a simple act of digitization (a transformation of singular books from boundary objects to open sets of data), at closer examination reveals a complex process teeming with diverse political, legal, and cultural investments. This book argues that mass digitization has become a global cultural political project. It offers an in-depth examination of mass digitization of cultural memory in the West and beyond. It suggests a new approach to the study of digital cultural memory archives, proposing to understand mass digitization not as neutral technical processes, but rather as distinct subpolitical processes that build new kinds of archives and new ways of interacting with these archives. And it seeks to develop a critical theoretical framework for understanding the new archival apparatuses and the politics and memory dynamics they give rise to.\"--","author":[{"family":"Thylstrup","given":"Nanna Bonde"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-262-03901-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"oclc: 1090427862\nuuid: 1BFA26C9-9432-45A5-8151-C919CAEE9260","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"The politics of mass digitization","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Tunink.etal+2017+AnnotoniaAnnotationsBrowser","abstract":"The Willa Cather Archive (WCA) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) is currently working on transcription and annotation of 1500 letters to be released in 2018. As editors will write several thousand annotations, the workflow logistics are complicated. Annotonia1 is a solution developed within the Center for Digital Research in Humanities (CDRH) that allows editors to write annotations directly on letters in a browser and insert those annotations into Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML files. Multiple editors review annotations, track letters’ annotation statuses, and generate a new TEI file incorporating the annotations, avoiding having to manually edit each file. Annotonia utilizes both pre-existing, customized open source software and new software developed for this project. This paper describes the difficulties faced, the workflow of Annotonia, and its prospects for future annotation work.","author":[{"family":"Tunink","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Dalziel","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Dussault","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Rau","given":"Emily"}],"container-title":"Digital Humanities 2017","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"language":"en","title":"Annotonia: Annotations from Browser to TEI","title-short":"Annotonia","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/488/488.pdf"},
  {"id":"Turska.etal+2016+ChallengingTheMyth","abstract":"Are the data of an edition means to a particular and privileged presentation, or is the presentation a side effect? Because of the changing nature of computer systems, with constant progression in hardware and software, the encoded texts are the most important long-term outcome of the project—the representation of the knowledge— and presentation within a particular application is destined to become obsolete relatively quickly.         However, it is most often the presentation output, rather than the source data, which is published and shared. We believe this is largely because there is currently no way of expressing, in the source encoding, aspects of presentation which are seen by editors as a crucial part of their work. Given a framework for encoding processing expectations for a variety of output formats, editors would be much more inclined to share the encoded files as their prime output, and intentions for presentation would be much more likely to survive repeated technology transitions as processing tools develop and change.         We believe the collision between the individuality of research and the quest for common tools that aid in the creation of digital editions will be solved not by creating another piece of specialized publishing software but rather by creating a general framework for processing TEI documents and similar, modular solutions for other tasks in the publishing workflow. Such an abstraction layer admittedly still requires some fluency in computer technologies, but far less than for setting up a publication system from scratch in a general-purpose programming language.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Turska","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Cummings","given":"James"},{"family":"Rahtz","given":"Sebastian"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative","DOI":"10/ghh5sx","ISSN":"2162-5603","issue":"Issue 9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,24]]},"language":"en","number":"Issue 9","publisher":"Text Encoding Initiative Consortium; https://web.archive.org/web/20210913141504/https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/1453","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"Challenging the Myth of Presentation in Digital Editions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/1453"},

  {"id":"Wittel+2013+CountercommodificationTheEconomy","abstract":"This is an article about digital production and the crisis of capitalism. It is about production in the digital commons and its implications for the building of alternatives to a commodified world. As digital production is at the very heart of cognitive capitalism, the digital commons is not just any other disruption of the process of commodification. This is the field of a fierce struggle over the future of the Internet and the future of capitalism itself. It is potentially the moment which moves back the frontiers of measurement, value and quantification towards qualities, values and an expansion of the gift economy. For this potential to unfold, it is vital that those who are giving, sharing, and contributing for the benefit of humanity are supported by global policies that enable them to do so. They have to be supported because their gifts are not based on reciprocity and the obligation to return the gift. This is an argument about the future of digital labour. The article concludes that this could be achieved through a global basic income scheme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wittel","given":"Andreas"}],"container-title":"Culture and Organization","DOI":"10/gmqgqq","ISSN":"1475-9551","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14759551.2013.827422","page":"314-331","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Counter-commodification: The economy of contribution in the digital commons","title-short":"Counter-commodification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14759551.2013.827422","volume":"19"},
