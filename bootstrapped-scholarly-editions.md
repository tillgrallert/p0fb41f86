<!-- importance of periodicals -->
 
Early Arabic periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries were at the core of social developments and formative discourses of modern(ising) societies that carry continued prominence across the region and beyond: such as the Arabic (cultural) renaissance (*nahḍa*), nationalism or the Islamic reform movement (*ṣalafiyya*). Yet, the vast majority of these journals and newspapers remain obscure and understudied beyond a few well-known titles from Beirut and Cairo. 
Periodicals are commonly perceived as being of ephemeral value. As physical artefacts---frequently printed with cheap ink on cheap paper and handled without care in transit---they are vulnerable to neglect and active destruction. Neoliberal defunding of cultural heritage institutions as a global phenomenon is compounded by an onslaught of iconoclasts, failing institutions, and wars ravaging Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.

# We need access

<!-- need: access -->
Turning to Gil and Ortega's question of "What do we need?"[^6], the answer, therefore {==is==}{>>seems<<} simple: preservation and access! {--This *we*, here, shall refer first and foremost to --}Societies of the Global South {--that--} have a right to unhampered access to their own cultural record---a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North.{>>and on their own terms<<} Access would also allow scholarly communities interested in the history of Middle Eastern societies to study them through their own cultural production. 

[^6]: [@Gil+2016, 29]

<!-- preservation is covered by access since it is a pre-condition for the former -->

# Inaccessibility of digitised artefacts

<!-- digitisation as solution but foremost a problem -->
Digitisation is the obvious answer to the need of preservation and access. Arabic periodicals are indeed being digitised and made available to online access for at least 15 years by a combination of private and public, non-profit and for-profit vendors. The terms *Digitised* and *access* have power to evoke hyperbolic promises. Their concrete meanings, however, are the crux of the matter. Depending on who we are, *digitised* artefacts are fraught with multiple layers of *inaccessibility*.  

<!-- history of the press is under researched -->

The first layer of *inaccessibility* is rooted in the physical artefact and its history{--, and the collections within which it is currently kept--}{>>see next paragraph<<}. First and foremost, we will not know what we are a looking for and where we could do so. This is true for the physical artefact as well as its digital remediation. There is a plethora of encyclopaedic works on the Arabic press, listing titles and dates of first publication, but the individual history of the vast majority of publications remains unknown---particularly for cities beyond Cairo and Beirut.[^1] We simply won't know which titles were published during, let's say, June 1910 in Aleppo.  

[^1]: {==Missing footnote==}{>>Arabic literature on the press<<}

<!-- collections: we are not the curators -->

The second layer of inaccessibility can be summarised by survival bias, collection bias, and digitisation bias. Surviving copies of early Arabic periodicals are scattered across libraries and private collections worldwide. {--Many collections remain unknown to scholarly communities.--} Known collections are frequently incomplete and predominantly located in the Global North. {--*We*, in the sense alluded to above, almost never had a chance to participate in curating these collections, which frequently--} Many periodical collections came about by chance and, to a large extent, reflect {>>local, regional and global<<} distribution networks and individual publishers' ability to gift library copies long after their publication.[^3] Existing catalogues are not necessarily published and with union catalogues haven fallen out of fashion[^12], we would also be at a loss in locating a specific publication or the press output from a particular place at a given time. Finally, in the absence of aggregators or an index to digitised periodicals, we would need to find the online platform(s) the holding institution(s) of a particular periodical collaborated with in digitising this title. Digitisation and hosting digital artefacts are expensive and the cost scales almost linearly. {>><<} Hundreds of thousands of periodical pages in foreign languages are frequently not considered important enough to warrant this investment for institutions in the Global North. On the other hand, funds, infrastructures and/or the physical artefacts are simply not available in the Global South. In consequence, we can observe a neo-colonial absence of the Global South from the digital cultural record.[^23]

{>>since we don't know how much was published, we cannot establish the relative amount of digitisation. Also, many institutions choose to scan the same periodical over and over again.<<}

[^3]: Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, for instance, gifted library copies of *al-Muqtabas* 2 from 1907/08 to his friend Jūrj Fākhūri in 1914 and to the library of al-Ṣalāḥiyya college in Jerusalem in 1916. The former is now held by the University of Minnesota and a facsimile is made available through [Hathitrust][hathitrust]. The later ended up in the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library in Jerusalem and was digitised by the British Library's [Endangered Archives Programme][eap]. Handwritten note on [*al-Muqtabas* 2(1), p.1](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_13.TEIP5.xml#pb_1.d2e814).

<!-- "technical" access: getting hold of the digital artefact -->
<!-- here, the we splits into haves and have-nots  -->

Once we established the potential location of the digitised artefact, we would need to get access to this remediation and immediately run into the third---{==socio-technical==}---layer of inaccessibility: Digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the epistemic hegemony of late twentieth-century, anglo-american neoliberal capitalism. 
First, most *digitised* periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of APIs or the option to download data in standardised, open file formats.
Second, reading *access* to these silos is restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing.
Third, bibliographic metadata is regularly limited to the issue level and woefully inadequate. This is due to ambiguity of data in the physical artefact, limited knowledge about these artefacts among librarians and the contractors, who did the actual digitising work, and software stacks incapable of handling anything but hegemonic Western concepts of dates and names and Western scripts. In consequence, bibliographic metadata are recorded and shared in transcription to Latin script---of which there are as many varieties as there are languages written in Latin script.[^5]
Fourth, proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic.[^4]
Fifth, downloading content in order to circumvent {>>geo-fencing and<<} ill-suited interfaces is limited to individually identifiable users. Bulk download frequently violates terms of use and most vendors try to prevent such violations on the technical level{-----at least in one case, bulk download will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range--}.


[^4]: On the need for Arabic interfaces see [@Mansour+2020; @Wrisley+2019; @Wrisley+2016]
[^5]: [@Grallert+2020]. Things have been improving over the years and many catalogues can now display Arabic script. But re-cataloguing is costly and not a priority for vendors. For an example, see EAP's digitisation of the Ottoman newspaper *Yenī Taṣvīr-i Efkār* from Istanbul, which was catalogued with the faulty Arabic title *Taṣwīr Afkār* and as published in Jerusalem; <https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-18-1#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0>.{>>try to link to the IIIF manifest<<} 

<!-- table: ../../s0fb41f86/table_accessibility-of-digitised-collections.md -->

<!-- accessing the artefact itself: being unable to read -->

Even if we gained access to the digital artefact, we'll find the artefact itself {==inaccessible to==}{>>better? resisting<<} scrutiny: 
*Digitised* commonly means scanned facsimiles with limited or no text layer due, inter alia, to the state of Arabic OCR.[^7] Available text layers are frequently hidden, while vendors foreground full-text "search" that won't ever report false negatives and verifiable information on error rates is either inexistent or not published.
On the other hand, grey online-libraries of Arabic literature, such as [*al-Maktaba al-shāmila*][shamela] (The Comprehensive Library), {--[*Mishkāt*][almeshkat], [*Ṣayyid al-Fawāʾid*][saaid] or [*al-Waraq*][alwaraq]--} provide access to a small number of full-text editions of Arabic periodicals based on the work of anonymous human transcribers. Unfortunately, they do not provide information on editorial principles, the quality of the transcription or the material artefact they were based on.[^8] In addition, such grey "editions" lack information linking the digital remediation to the original artefact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research. In a final twist, the grey editions from *al-Maktaba al-shāmila*, with all their gaps and omissions, were rendered as images with a pseudo-original layout to provide "fakesimiles" served through [*Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya*][alsharekh] (Archive of literary and cultural Arabic journals), the largest Arabic online platform for historical periodicals. {>>missing: consequence for scholarly research<<}
<!-- modelling? Na! -->


[^7]: Because large-scale digitisation takes time, [@Märgner+2012a] is still relevant for current platforms; see the Internet Archive's claim that Arabic is "currently not OCRable"; e.g. <https://archive.org/details/1_20191109_20191109_1843>. Recent years have seen huge advances in the field with the application of machine-learning algorithms; c.f. [@Kiessling+2017]. They will eventually find their way into Hathitrust etc.; see {==missing reference==}{>>announcement of grant for OpenITI, https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc-awards-three-acs-projects<<}. But without GUI's (in Arabic!) and due to their reliance on server-side computing, which needs to be paid, these remain largely inaccessible {==to the general public==}{>>improve<<}.  

[^8]: We found that *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* consequently removed footnotes and terms in scripts other than Arabic. Transcribers normalised the text occasionally left notes in the text, stating that they couldn't decipher a line etc., from which we know that they were Arabic speakers.

<!-- Affordances of the Global South -->
These layers of inaccessibility have an already crippling effect on any Arabic speaker from Syria, Jordan or Palestine with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North.{--, we are faced by multiple levels of *inaccessibility*.--} They are, however, further compounded by the infrastructural dependencies of digital remediations on access to devices, internet connections, and electricity. Neither of these can be taken for granted for the societies of the Global South. In the---all too frequent---worst case, devices are old, internet connections are slow, traffic is prohibitively expensive, and electricity is perilously scarce.[^11] Let me illustrate this "digital divide"[^15] with an example: At least 30 per cent of the population live on less than 120 USD a month in Lebanon.[^9] Yet, we pay about 40 USD for 20GB traffic or 30-days of mobile internet connection, whatever is less. We depend on mobile internet because landlords avoid paying council tax. In consequence, we cannot register our rent contract with the council and we cannot sing-up for a landline without a registered rent contract.[^10] Electricity for our home of four costs about 120 USD per month, including regular daily power cuts of three hours (and an ever increasing number of irregular outages). Generator subscription comes in at another 80 USD.

# solution: bootstrapping

["Open Arabic Periodical Editions" (OpenArabicPE)][openarabicpe_blog] was born out of frustration in August 2015 to address the socio-technical layers of inaccessibility of existing digitised Arabic periodicals with the affordances of the Global South. {>>I met Alex Gil in spring and summer 2015<<} Building on the guiding principles of *simplicity* of *credibility* for the sake of *accessibility* and *sustainability*, OpenArabicPE represents a simple idea inspired by Alex Gil's talk on *minimal computing* at [Digital Humanities Institute---Beirut][dhib] and discussions at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute][dhsi] 2015: re-use---sometimes creatively---openly available data, tools, and infrastructures in order to produce open, collaborative, scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals. OpenArabicPE also represents (and reflects the chaning boundaries of) my ability "to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, without the help we can't get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of, with, and beyond institutional libraries and schools."[^22]

## data layer

On the data level, we combine the virtues of immensely popular, but non-academic {--(and, at least under US copyright laws, occasionally illegal)--}grey online libraries of volunteers on the one hand with academic/institutional scanning efforts as well as editorial expertise on the other. To this end, we transform digital texts from [*al-Maktaba al-shāmila*][shamela] into an open, standardised file format (XML) following the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)][tei]'s guidelines[^2] and link each page to digital facsimiles from various sources, namely [EAP][eap], [HathiTrust][hathitrust], and [*Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya*][alsharekh]. We also model the periodicals with light structural mark-up for articles, sections, mastheads and bylines and other bibliographic information.[^13] Bibliographic metadata on every article and in common standardised formats such as BibTeX and MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema) is then automatically generated from the modelled source.[^16] Thus, we provide the advantages of truly digital editions and a means to verify the text layer and our mark-up against facsimiles of the original artefact. Linking page breaks to facsimiles, although trivial, is extremely labour-intensive because they seemingly did not matter enough to the anonymous transcribers of *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* to be consistently recorded. Each of the c.8000 page breaks in [*al-Muqtabas*][muqtabas_git] and [*al-Ḥaqāʾiq*][haqaiq_git], therefore, needed to be manually marked up by volunteers.[^14] My gratitude goes to Dimitar Dragnev, Talha Güzel, Dilan Hatun, Hans Magne Jaatun, Xaver Kretzschmar, Daniel Lloyd, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick, Manzi Tanna-Händel and Layla Youssef, who have contributed their time to this task.

{>>comment on linking: legally saver, hosting and sharing images is expensive and we cannot afford it<<}

[^2]: TEI XML is the quasi-standard of textual editing and required by funding bodies and repositories for long-term archiving; cf. [@DfgPraxisregelnDigitalisierung+2016].
[^13]: Our TEI customisation for Arabic periodicals is available at [Github][openarabicpe_schema].
[^14]: In other instances, such as the journals [*Lughat al-ʿArab*][lughat_git] and [*al-Ustādh*][ustadh_git], *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* did provide page breaks that correspond to a printed edition.
[^16]: Our code is openly available at <https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/convert_tei-to-bibliographic-data>. It uses `<tei:biblStruct>` as an intermediary format and can also generate YAML and Zotero RDF.

## presentation layer

TEI XML is certainly not *simple* and comes with a steep learning curve. Bidirectional XML with left-to-right tags and right-to-left text is not particularly *accessible* either, even if specialised XML-editing software would better support it. However, TEI is both *sustainable* and *credible* as an underlying format and the direction of a script is only relevant if rendered on a two-dimensional surface for human readers and editors. Presenting facsimiles and text layers side-by-side for the validation of the latter with the help of the former is core to OpenArabicPE's claim of credibility. Therefore, and in order to make the editions accessible to readers with as little overhead as possible, we heavily modified the [TEI Boilerplate](http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp/) for the use with Arabic texts. Our adaptation of the TEI Boilerplate also provides access to a table of contents, limited browsing to neighbouring issues, and bibliographic metadata on the article level.[^17] By rendering XML files locally in a web browser on the reader's computer with XSLT 1 transformations and CSS we remove the need for backend servers and internet connections. Editions can be downloaded, distributed through USB keys and run locally. This also removes the need to produce reading surrogates whenever the main TEI XML was changed.

[^17]: {==missing reference to TEI Boilerplate==}. Our version of the TEI Boilerplate is openly available at <https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/tei-boilerplate-arabic-editions>.

Linking to digital facsimiles already available on the internet is commonly legal and since hosting and serving large files is expensive, it is the preferred option from our project's point of view. If we were to produce our own facsimiles through scanning, I would recommend uploading them to the [Internet Archive][internetarchive], which currently develops IIIF support.[^21] But from the readers' perspective, linked online facsimiles require stable, fast and affordable internet connections. Downloading them once and serving them from the local machine would be the preferred option but will most likely violate user agreements, licences and copyright depending on the vendor and jurisdiction. It is, nevertheless, trivial since the links are part of the TEI XML files' `<facsimile>`. 

[^21]: According to example code in the documentation, IIIF support is in development since at least 2015; [@IIIFDocumentation].

<!-- Zotero: solves the problem of browsing/search across issues with no backend -->
Distributing digital corpora of hundreds of periodical issues without a backend severely restricts the ability to search and browser across issues. The (academic) reference manager [Zotero][zotero] is a staple of the open-source community, which, among many other things, allows sharing an unlimited amount of bibliographic references for free. I, therefore, opted to host all bibliographic metadata in a constantly updated public [Zotero Group][openarabicpe_zotero] instead of building a static website with pre-computed indexes, tables of contents etc. Each reference in Zotero links to the relevant section in the periodical editions through a stable URL. Readers can, therefore, use either Zotero's web interface or standalone client as a port of entry to all of OpenArabicPE's editions. I also contemplate attaching the full text of each article to the Zotero references as a note to provide basic full-text search across the entire corpus.

## Facilitating re-use through licenses

There are great arguments for copyleft but within the academic framework we are operating in, we depend on explicit licences to facilitate the use and re-use of our data and tools.[^18] We assume that the content of periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean before 1920 is in the public domain even under the most restrictive definitions (i.e. US copyright law). {>>this view is obviously shared by all vendors of facsimiles<<} The enormous amount of human labour required for digitising cultural artefacts, on the other hand, is commonly actively hidden---within academic historiography, for instance, using digital remediations is quite commonly perceived as cheating (everybody does it but only few talk about it). Retaining copyright of our own editorial contributions in the form of [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][cc-by-sa-4] {==is at least a reminder that all contributors need to be transparently credited==}{>>phrasing<<} for their work. {==We share our tools under a [MIT licence][mit-license] whenever possible. ==}{>>this needs more work<<}

[^18]: For a great introduction to the conceptual critique of copyrights see [@Hall+2016, 1-9].

## infrastructure / tool chain

Editions and tools are maintained using a combination of `.git` and [GitHub](github) for distributed version control. Each edit is transparently credited to a contributor with an email address and a timestamp. Github also provides free hosting of the {--TEI Boilerplate --}webview for our editions through [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. Github, of course, is a commercial platform and nowadays owned by Microsoft. They might go out of business at any point in the future but they are a core staple of the open-source movement. The platform itself is built on open-source software, protecting us against a lock-in of our data, and its {==services==}{>>expand on what they are<<} are free-of-cost to the user.

<!-- Zenodo -->
While platforms for shared version control, such as GitHub, are great for collaborative editing and hosting data, they cannot replace archive or long-term repository. To this end, we upload every release of our data to [Zenodo][zenodo], an open and free-to-use, EU-funded research data repository originally developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Zenodo registers (versioned) [Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)][doi] and integrates with various Open Science infrastructures such as scholarly aggregators of metadata or [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)][orcid] for unambiguously identifying contributors. Zenodo also integrates with GitHub by automatically archiving each release and recording all contributors as fund in the `.git` repository. 


## problems

The main problem of bootstrapping is the reliance on external data, tools, and services, which are beyond our control. Every one of these dependencies will break eventually break. The only question is when. The main mitigation strategies are open and widely supported standard and a minimal software stack. On the data level, the connection to the facsimiles is the most volatile component and we already encountered three major instances of link rot. Two were caused by vendors moving servers and changing protocols: The British Library moved the Endangered Archives Programme to IIIF in 2017 and *Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya* moved to {==a new domain==}{>>from http://archive.sakhrit.co to http://archive.alsharekh.org/ <<} in 2019. In another instance, Hathitrust removed the facsimiles of Princeton's copy of *al-Haqāʾiq* (vol.1, 1910) from the public domain in 2016---my inquiries about the legal basis for this decision have not been replied to.

On the representation layer, TEI Boilerplate was the only viable option to render TEI XML files in the browser without a backend in 2015 and it still works. However, web browsers and the TEI {--world--} have moved on. All major browsers still support XSLT transformation but with two limitations: First, {==the web has moved on==}{>>better phrasing<<} to Javascript and JSON. XSLT support is stuck with version 1, which was superseded by XSLT 2 in 2007 and XSLT 3 in 2017. If (!) browsers continue to support XSLT, it won't be further developed. Second, browser vendors tighten the screws on security. Running XSLT transformations on local files is considered attempted cross-site scripting and, consequently, aborted by Google's Chrome. Firefox will transform local XML files but only with remotely hosted XSLT. At the time of writing, only Apple's Safari allows for rendering our editions without any internet connection.{>>According to the documentation, a local webserver, i.e. `localhost`, is fine<<} Third, [CETEIcean][ceteicean] has matured into a Javascript-based alternative to TEI Boilerplate with the support of the TEI consortium.[^19] All future developments of OpenArabicPE's webview will therefore move to CETEIcean.

Hosting is another challenge. I originally decided to directly render XML files as available in the GitHub repositories. This made sure that readers always saw the most current version of the data without any additional steps. [Rawgit][rawgit-old] allowed to directly serve "files from <raw.githubusercontent.com>, but with the correct content types". The service was shut down in 2019 since people ran malware exploits directly from GitHub repositories.[^20] OpenArabicPE has therefore moved to GitHub's own [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] service, which serves files any repositories `gh-pages` branch as they are.

[^19]: {==missing footnote no CETEIcean==}
[^20]: While <http://rawgit.com> shut down in 2019, there since emerged a replacement service at <https://rawgit.org/>.
