# 3. Open Arabic Periodical Editions
## 3.1 Re-use available material

Arabic periodicals are being digitised and made available to online access for at least 15 years by a combination of private and public, non-profit and for-profit vendors. The meanings of *digitised* and *access*, however, are the crux of the matter. If we imagine ourselves to be an Arabic speaker from Jordan with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North, we are faced by multiple levels of *inaccessibility*. 
<!-- locating a periodical -->
We will immediately find that we will not know what and where to look for. In the absence of union catalogues for Arabic periodicals, one needs to know the title of a periodical, potential holding institutions of the physical artefact, and the various platforms serving digitised artefacts in collaboration with the holding institution.   

<!-- "technical" access: getting hold of the digital artefact -->
Once we established the potential location of the digitised artefact, we would need to get access to the files and immediately run into the second layer of inaccessibility:
First, most *digitised* periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of APIs or the option to download data in standardised, open file formats.
Second, reading *access* to these silos is restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing.
Third, proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic.
Fourth, downloading content that in order to circumvent ill-suited interfaces is limited to individually identifiable users. Bulk download frequently violates terms of use and most vendors try to prevent such violations on the technical level{>>---at least in one case, bulk download will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range<<}.

Even if we gained access to the digital artefact, we'll find the artefact itself inaccessible to scrutiny:
First, *Digitised* frequently means scanned facsimiles with limited or no text layer due, inter alia, to the state of Arabic OCR. Available text layers are frequently hidden and one cannot find verifiable information on error rates. Vendors tend to foreground full-text "search" that won't ever report false negatives.
Second, we can neither search nor browse properly.
- Reliable bibliographic metadata is practically absent on the article level.
