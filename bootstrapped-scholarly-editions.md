<!-- importance of periodicals -->
 
Early Arabic periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean from the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries were at the core of social developments and formative discourses of modern(ising) societies that carry continued prominence across the region and beyond: such as the Arabic (cultural) renaissance (*nahḍa*), nationalism or the Islamic reform movement (*ṣalafiyya*). Yet, the vast majority of these journals and newspapers remain obscure and understudied beyond a few well-known titles from Beirut and Cairo. 
Periodicals are commonly perceived as being of ephemeral value. As physical artefacts---frequently printed with cheap ink on cheap paper and handled without care in transit---they are vulnerable to neglect and active destruction. Neoliberal defunding of cultural heritage institutions as a global phenomenon is compounded by an onslaught of iconoclasts, failing institutions, and wars ravaging Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.

# We need access

<!-- need: access -->
Turning to Gil and Ortega's question of "What do we need?"[^6], the answer, therefore {==is==}{>>seems<<} simple: preservation and access! {--This *we*, here, shall refer first and foremost to --}Societies of the Global South {--that--} have a right to unhampered access to their own cultural record---a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North.{>>and on their own terms<<} Access would also allow scholarly communities interested in the history of Middle Eastern societies to study them through their own cultural production. 

[^6]: [@Gil+2016, 29]

<!-- preservation is covered by access since it is a pre-condition for the former -->

# Problematic state of digitisation

<!-- digitisation as solution but foremost a problem -->
Digitisation is the obvious answer to the need of preservation and access. Arabic periodicals are indeed being digitised and made available to online access for at least 15 years by a combination of private and public, non-profit and for-profit vendors. The terms *Digitised* and *access* have power to evoke hyperbolic promises. Their concrete meanings, however, are the crux of the matter. Depending on who we are, *digitised* artefacts are fraught with multiple layers of *inaccessibility*.  

<!-- history of the press is under researched -->

The first layer of *inaccessibility* is rooted in the physical artefact and its history{--, and the collections within which it is currently kept--}{>>see next paragraph<<}. First and foremost, we will not know what we are a looking for and where we could do so. This is true for the physical artefact as well as its digital remediation. There is a plethora of encyclopaedic works on the Arabic press, listing titles and dates of first publication, but the individual history of the vast majority of publications remains unknown---particularly for cities beyond Cairo and Beirut.[^1] We simply won't know which titles were published during, let's say, June 1910 in Aleppo.  

[^1]: {==Missing footnote==}{>>Arabic literature on the press<<}

<!-- collections: we are not the curators -->

The second layer of inaccessibility can be summarised by survival bias, collection bias, and digitisation bias. Surviving copies of early Arabic periodicals are scattered across libraries and private collections worldwide. {--Many collections remain unknown to scholarly communities.--} Known collections are frequently incomplete and predominantly located in Global North. {--*We*, in the sense alluded to above, almost never had a chance to participate in curating these collections, which frequently--} Many periodical collections came about by chance and, to a large extent, reflect {>>local, regional and global<<} distribution networks and individual publishers' ability to gift library copies long after their publication.[^3] Existing catalogues are not necessarily published and with union catalogues haven fallen out of fashion[^12], we would also be at a loss in locating a specific publication or the press output from a particular place at a given time. Finally, we would need to find the online platform(s) the holding institution(s) of a particular periodical collaborated with in digitising this title.
{>>add comment on neo-colonial absence of the GLobal South from the digital cultural record and the resulting epistemic violence. [@Risam+2019] Digitisation is costly, periodicals are considered of lesser importance, particularly in those in foreign languages<<}

{>>since we don't know how much was published, we cannot establish the relative amount of digitisation. Also, many institutions choose to scan the same periodical over and over again.<<}

[^3]: Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, for instance, gifted library copies of *al-Muqtabas* 2 from 1907/08 to his friend Jūrj Fākhūri in 1914 and to the library of al-Ṣalāḥiyya college in Jerusalem in 1916. The former is now held by the University of Minnesota and a facsimile is made available through Hathitrust. The later ended up in the al-Aqṣā Mosque's library in Jerusalem and was digitised by the British Library's Endangered Archives Programme. Handwritten note on [*al-Muqtabas* 2(1), p.1](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_13.TEIP5.xml#pb_1.d2e814).

<!-- "technical" access: getting hold of the digital artefact -->
<!-- here, the we splits into haves and have-nots  -->

Once we established the potential location of the digitised artefact, we would need to get access to this remediation and immediately run into the third---{==socio-technical==}---layer of inaccessibility: Digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the epistemic hegemony of late twentieth-century, anglo-american neoliberal capitalism. 
First, most *digitised* periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of APIs or the option to download data in standardised, open file formats.
Second, reading *access* to these silos is restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing.
Third, bibliographic metadata is regularly limited to the issue level and woefully inadequate. This is due to ambiguity of data in the physical artefact, limited knowledge about these artefacts among librarians and the contractors, who did the actual digitising work, and software stacks incapable of handling anything but hegemonic Western concepts of dates and names and Western scripts. In consequence, bibliographic metadata are recorded and shared in transcription to Latin script---of which there are as many varieties as there are languages written in Latin script.[^5]
Fourth, proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic.[^4]
Fifth, downloading content in order to circumvent {>>geo-fencing and<<} ill-suited interfaces is limited to individually identifiable users. Bulk download frequently violates terms of use and most vendors try to prevent such violations on the technical level{-----at least in one case, bulk download will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range--}.


[^4]: On the need for Arabic interfaces see [@Mansour+2020; @Wrisley+2019; @Wrisley+2016]
[^5]: [@Grallert+2020]. Things are improving over the years and many catalogues can display Arabic script. But re-cataloguing is costly and not a priority for vendors. For an example, see EAP's digitisation of the Ottoman newspaper *Yenī Taṣvīr-i Efkār* from Istanbul, which was catalogued with the faulty Arabic title *Taṣwīr Afkār* and as published in Jerusalem; <https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-18-1#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0>.{>>try to link to the IIIF manifest<<}

Table: Accessibility of *digitised* Arabic periodicals


[^a]: Include "fakesimiles" of digital text from *al-maktaba al-shāmila* rendered as images with a layout mimicing the original layout.
[^b]: Claims a "proprietary" PDF version, whose text layer is currently incompatible with Adobe's PDF reader.
[^c]: Geo-fencing restricts access to Arabic periodicals to users with US IPs even when the material is in the public domain.
[^d]: Copy from *al-Maktaba al-shāmila*.

<!-- accessing the artefact itself: being unable to read -->

Even if we gained access to the digital artefact, we'll find the artefact itself {==inaccessible to==}{>>better? resisting<<} scrutiny: 
*Digitised* frequently means scanned facsimiles with limited or no text layer due, inter alia, to the state of Arabic OCR.[^7] Available text layers are frequently hidden and one cannot find verifiable information on error rates. Vendors tend to foreground full-text "search" that won't ever report false negatives.
On the other hand, grey online-libraries of Arabic literature, such as [*al-Maktaba al-shāmila*](http://www.shamela.ws/) (The Comprehensive Library), {--[*Mishkāt*][almeshkat], [*Ṣayyid al-Fawāʾid*][saaid] or [*al-Waraq*][alwaraq]--} provide access to a small number of full-text editions of Arabic periodicals based on the work of anonymous human transcribers. Unfortunately, they do not provide information on editorial principles, the quality of the transcription or the material artefact they were based on.[^8] In addition, such grey "editions" lack information linking the digital remediation to the original artefact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research. In a final twist, the grey editions from *al-Maktaba al-shāmila*, with all their gaps and omissions, were rendered as images with a pseudo-original layout to provide "fakesimiles" served through [*Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya*](http://archive.alsharekh.org/) (Archive of literary and cultural Arabic journals), the largest Arabic online platform for historical periodicals. 
<!-- modelling? Na! -->


[^7]: Because large-scale digitisation takes time, [@Märgner+2012a] is still relevant for current platforms; see the Internet Archive's claim that Arabic is "currently not OCRable"; e.g. <https://archive.org/details/1_20191109_20191109_1843>. Recent years have seen huge advances in the field with the application of machine-learning algorithms; c.f. [@Kiessling+2017]. They will eventually find their way into Hathitrust etc.; see {==missing reference==}{>>announcement of grant for OpenITI, https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc-awards-three-acs-projects<<}. But without GUI's (in Arabic!) and due to their reliance on server-side computing, which needs to be paid, these remain largely inaccessible {==to the general public==}{>>improve<<}.  

[^8]: We found that *al-Maktaba al-shāmila* consequently removed footnotes and terms in scripts other than Arabic. Transcribers normalised the text occasionally left notes in the text, stating that they couldn't decipher a line etc., from which we know that they were Arabic speakers.

<!-- Affordances of the Global South -->
These layers of inaccessibility have an already crippling effect on any Arabic speaker from Syria, Jordan or Palestine with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North.{--, we are faced by multiple levels of *inaccessibility*.--} They are, however, further compounded by the infrastructural dependencies of digital remediations on access to devices, internet connections, and electricity. Neither of these can be taken for granted for the societies of the Global South. In the---all too frequent---worst case, devices are old, internet connections are slow, traffic is prohibitively expensive, and electricity is perilously scarce.[^11] Let me illustrate this "digital divide" with an example: At least 30 per cent of the population live on less than 120 USD a month in Lebanon.[^9] Yet, we pay about 40 USD for 20GB traffic or 30-days of mobile internet connection, whatever is less. We depend on mobile internet because landlords avoid paying council tax. In consequence, we cannot register our rent contract with the council and we cannot sing-up for a landline without a registered rent contract.[^10] Electricity for our home of four costs about 120 USD per month, including regular daily power cuts of three hours (and an ever increasing number of irregular outages). The generator subscription comes in at another 80 USD.
